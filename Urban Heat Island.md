## Questions:

1. Bring out the causes for the formation of heat islands in the urban habitat of the world

# Urban Heat Island

- Introduction
	- A **heat island** simply means that cities are hotter than their rural surroundings, especially at night. 
	- Why? Because of how humans alter the land surface and atmosphere when they build cities.
- Causes of Heat Island Formation
	- Surface properties of cities
		- Rural areas: 
			- soil, vegetation, water bodies → absorb heat in the day, release slowly, and encourage cooling via evaporation
		- Urban areas: 
			- asphalt, concrete, glass, metal → dark, dense, and low in reflectivity (albedo). 
			- These materials **soak up solar energy like a sponge** and release it back as heat, raising local temperatures.
	- Loss of vegetation
		- Plants cool surroundings through **evapotranspiration** (water evaporating from soil and leaves)
		- When trees and green cover are replaced by roads and buildings, this natural cooling mechanism disappears.
	- Urban geometry (“canyon effect”)
		- Narrow streets surrounded by tall buildings trap radiation.
	- Waste heat from human activities
		- Air conditioners, vehicles, factories, and power generation add extra heat to the environment.
	- Air pollution
		- Dust, soot, and aerosols absorb and re-radiate heat.
		- Pollution also reduces long-wave radiation escape at night, functioning like a **thermal blanket**
- Conclusion
	- UHI effect poses significant challenges to public health, energy demand, and climate resilience. 
	- Measures like increasing green cover, reflective roofing, sustainable urban design, and improved ventilation can mitigate its impact
