## Questions:

1. Analyse the role of local bodies in providing good governance at local level and bring out the pros and cons of merging the rural local bodies with the urban local bodies.

# Merging rural and urban local bodies

- Introduction
	- India’s governance system currently maintains a rural-urban distinction, but urbanisation blurs this boundary: peri-urban areas, census towns, and “rurban” settlements don’t fit neatly into one category.
	- The idea of merging rural and urban local bodies presents both opportunities and challenges
- Pros of Merger
	- Integrated Planning
		- A unified body can better manage regional issues like transportation, waste management, infrastructure that cut across rural-urban divide
	- Resource Pooling
		- It allows for efficient allocation of financial and technical resources, enabling larger and impactful projects
	- Administrative efficiency
		- It can resolve administrative confusion and conflicts over jurisdictions
- Cons of merging
	- Dilution of rural voice
		- The more powerful urban interests might overshadow the specific needs of the rural populace
	- Risk of centralisation
		- Bigger merged bodies could become distant from people, reversing the principle of subsidiarity
	- Dilution of Representation
		- A larger, merged entity could reduce the number of representatives per capita
- Conclusion
	- A complete merger may not be ideal. 
	- A more nuanced approach is to empower and operationalise constitutional bodies like the District Planning Committee (Article 243ZD) to ensure coordinated planning while respecting the distinct governance needs of rural and urban areas.
