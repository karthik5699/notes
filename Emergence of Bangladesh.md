# Emergence of Bangladesh

India was prompted to play a decisive role in the emergence of Bangladesh due to a confluence of factors, primarily stemming from the internal crisis within Pakistan and its direct repercussions on India, alongside evolving international alignments.

- The crisis began when Pakistan faced a severe internal upheaval starting in 1970. 
- The country's first general election resulted in a split verdict: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's party won in West Pakistan, while Sheikh Mujib-ur Rahman's Awami League secured a majority of seats in East Pakistan. 
- The Bengali population of East Pakistan had voted as a protest against being treated as second-class citizens by the West Pakistani rulers. 
- However, the Pakistani rulers were unwilling to accept this democratic verdict or the Awami League's demand for a federation. Instead, in early 1971, the Pakistani army arrested Sheikh Mujib and unleashed a reign of terror and brutal terror activities on the people of East Pakistan, suppressing their voices. 
- This led the people of Eastern Pakistan to initiate a liberation struggle for Bangladesh

Compulsions that prompted India's decisive involvement were:
- Massive Influx of Refugees: 
	- Throughout 1971, India had to bear the enormous burden of about 80 lakh (8 million) refugees who fled East Pakistan and sought shelter in neighbouring areas in India. 
	- This created a significant strain on India's economy and resources
- Humanitarian and Moral Support: 
	- India felt compelled to extend moral and material support to the freedom struggle in Bangladesh. 
	- The presence of large numbers of refugees and the atrocities being committed in East Pakistan necessitated a response.
- Security Concerns and International Realignment: 
	- Pakistan accused India of a conspiracy to break it up. 
	- Support for West Pakistan came from the United States and China, leading to a US-Pakistan-China axis. 
		- Henry Kissinger, the adviser to the US President Richard Nixon, made a secret visit to China via Pakistan in July 1971
	- To counter this emerging alignment and ensure its own safety, India signed a 20-year Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Soviet Union in August 1971, which assured India of Soviet support in case of an attack
- Political Pressure and National Interest: 
	- The grim economic scenario of the mid-1960s had already made economic self-reliance and food self-sufficiency top priorities for Indian leadership. 
	- The ongoing crisis and the burden of refugees reinforced the need for decisive action to protect India's national interests.

After months of diplomatic tension and military build-up, a full-scale war broke out in December 1971 between India and Pakistan. The Indian army, supported by the local population in the form of "Mukti Bahini," made rapid progress in East Pakistan, compelling the Pakistani troops to surrender within ten days. With the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country, India declared a unilateral ceasefire.

The Shimla Agreement of 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto formalized the return of peace, and India has since argued for this agreement as the framework for resolving disputes between the two countries. The decisive victory in the war significantly boosted Indira Gandhi's popularity and was seen as a moment of glory for India.
