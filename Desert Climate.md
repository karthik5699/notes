# Desert Climate

![[Pasted image 20250716144459.png]]

- Introduction
	- Deserts are regions where evaporation exceeds precipitation
	- There are mainly two types – hot like the hot deserts of the Saharan type and temperate as are the mid-latitude deserts like the Gobi
- Hot Desert Climate
	- The aridity of the hot deserts is mainly due to the effects of off-shore Trade Winds, hence they are also called Trade Wind Deserts
	- The major hot deserts of the world are located on the western coasts of continents <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">between latitudes 15° and 30° N and S</mark>
	- They include the biggest Sahara Desert (3.5 million square miles), Great Australian Desert, Arabian Desert, Iranian Desert, Thar Desert, Kalahari and Namib Deserts.
	- In North America, the desert extends from Mexico into U.S.A. and is called by different names at different places, e.g. the Mohave
	- ![[Pasted image 20250716144952.png]]
	- In South America, the Atacama or Peruvian Desert (rain shadow effect and off-shore trade winds) is the driest of all deserts with less than 2 cm of rainfall annually.
- Mid-Latitude Desert Climate
	- The temperate deserts are rainless because of either **continentiality or rain-shadow effect.** (**Gobi desert** is formed due to **continentiality** and **Patagonian desert** due to **rain-shadow effect**)
	- Amongst the mid-latitude deserts, many are found on plateau and are at a considerable distance from the sea. These are Ladakh, Gobi etc.

- Desert Climate
	- Rainfall (Both Hot and Cold deserts)
		- Deserts, whether hot or mid-latitude have an annual precipitation of less than 25 cm
		- Atacama (driest place on earth) has practically no rain at all
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Major hot deserts in northern hemisphere are located between 20-30 degree north and on the western side of the continents. Why?</mark>
		- ![[Pasted image 20250716150755.png]]
		- The hot deserts lie along the Horse Latitudes or the Sub-Tropical High Pressure Belts where the air is descending, a condition least favourable for precipitation of any kind to take place
		- Whatever winds reach the deserts blow from cooler to warmer regions, and their relative humidity is lowered, making condensation almost impossible.
		- There is scarcely any cloud in the continuous blue sky. The relative humidity is extremely low, decreasing from 60 per cent in coastal districts to less than 30 per cent in the desert interiors. 
		- Under such conditions, every bit of moisture is evaporated and the deserts are thus regions of permanent drought. 
		- On the western coasts, the presence of cold currents gives rise to **mists and fogs** by chilling the on-coming air. This air is later warmed by contact with the hot land, and little rain falls. The desiccating effect of the **cold Peruvian Current** along the Chilean coast is so pronounced that the mean annual rainfall for the Atacama Desert is not more than 1.3 cm.
- Temperature of Hot deserts
	- There is no cold season in the hot deserts and the average summer temperature is high around 30°C
	- The reasons for the high temperatures are obvious—a clear, cloudless sky, intense insolation, dry air and a rapid rate of evaporation
	- Coastal deserts by virtue of their maritime influence and the cooling effect of the cold currents have much lower temperatures.
	- The diurnal range of temperature in the deserts is very great. 
		- Intense insolation by day in a region of dry air and no clouds causes the temperature to rise with the sun
		- But as soon as the sun sets, the land loses heat very quickly by radiation
	- High diurnal temperature range is a typical feature of hot deserts
	- Frosts may occur at night in winter.
	
- Climatic Conditions in the Mid-Latitude deserts
	- These inland basins lie hundreds of miles from the sea, and are sheltered by the high mountains all around them. As a result they are cut off from the rain-bearing winds
	- The annual range of temperature is much greater than that of the hot deserts. Continentiality accounts for these extremes in temperature.
		- Summers can be very hot. Winters can be very cold.
		
- Desert Vegetation
	- ![[Pasted image 20250716151855.png]]
	- The predominant vegetation of both hot and mid-latitude deserts is **xerophytic** or drought-resistant
	- This includes the cacti, thorny bushes, long-rooted wiry grasses and scattered dwarf acacias
	- Trees are rare except where there is abundant ground water to support clusters of **date palms**
	- Intense evaporation increases the salinity of the soil so that the dissolved salts tend to accumulate on the surface forming hard pans (Bajada, Playa)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250716152320.png]]
- Life in the Deserts
	- Despite its inhospitality, the desert has always been peopled by different groups of inhabitants.
	- The settled cultivators
		- The life-giving waters of the Nile made it possible for the Egyptians to raise many crops as early as 5,000 years ago
	- The mining settlers
		- It was gold that brought immigrants scrambling into the Great Australian Desert.
		- In the Kalahari Desert, the discovery of **diamonds** and **copper** has brought many white men to the ‘thirstland’ as it is called
		- Even in the most arid Atacama, in northern Chile, large mining camps have been established for the mining of **caliche (cemented gravels)** from which **sodium nitrate**, a valuable fertiliser, is extracted and exported to all parts of the world
		- In recent years, the discovery of oil, in many parts of the Saharan and Arabian Deserts has transformed this forgotten part of the globe.
		- Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, Libya, Lebanon, Nigeria etc. are important oil producing desert countries
