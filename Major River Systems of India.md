# Major River Systems of India

- Introduction
	- A river drains the water collected from a specific area, which is called its ‘catchment area’.
	- An area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a drainage basin
	- The flow of water through well-defined channels is known as drainage. The network of such channels is called a drainage system.
	- The catchments of large rivers are called river basins, while those of small rivulets and rills are often referred to as watersheds
		- Example: watershed of Yamuna + watershed of Chambal + watershed of Gandak + …. = Drainage basin of Ganga.
- Why the Bay of Bengal receives more fresh water compared to the Arabian Sea?
	- ![[Pasted image 20250730162723.png]]
	- The Arabian Sea drainage receives less rainfall. On the other hand, the Bay of Bengal drainage receives rainfall from both southwest and northeast monsoons.
	- Most of the Himalayan waters flow into the Bay of Bengal in the form of the Ganga-Brahmaputra River system. 
	- Moreover, all the major rivers of the peninsular region drain into the Bay of Bengal.
	- More cyclonic rainfall occurs in the Bay of Bengal drainage area.
- Classification based on Origin
	- The Himalayan Drainage
		- Most Himalayan rivers are perennial as both snowmelt and precipitation feed them
		- The Himalayan drainage comprises the Ganga, the Indus, and the Brahmaputra basins
		- They perform intense erosion in their upper courses and transport large silt and sand loads. 
		- In the upper courses, they form deep gorges, V-shaped valleys, rapids, and waterfalls
		- In the middle and lower courses, they form depositional features like flat valleys, ox-bow lakes, flood plains, braided channels, and deltas
		- River Kosi, also called the ‘sorrow of Bihar’, is notorious for frequently changing its course. It brings a huge quantity of sediments from its upper reaches and deposits it in the plains
		- High hydroelectric potential due to steep gradients
	- The Peninsular Drainage
		- The Peninsular drainage comprises all the river basins in India that are to the south of the Himalayan Drainage.
		- The Peninsular drainage system is older than the Himalayan drainage system. This is evident from the broad, largely graded shallow valleys and the maturity of the rivers.
		- Most major rivers flow east-wards and drain into the Bay of Bengal.
		- Peninsular rivers have a fixed course, no meanders, and non-perennial flow
		- Exceptions
			- Narmada and Tapi are the only major peninsular rivers flowing west into the Arabian Sea. 
			- Unlike other peninsular rivers, these rivers have a meandering course and perennial flow. 
			- They show this exceptional behavior because they flow through rift valleys
		- West Flowing Peninsular Rivers Do Not Form Deltas
			- They do not have enough silt to form deltas because:
				- The Western Ghats have a steep slope, resulting in the rapid flow of these rivers
				- They do not have to travel much distance to drain into the sea
				- The topography of Western Peninsular India is rocky
		- Lower hydroelectric potential due to gentler gradients
