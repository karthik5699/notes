## Questions:



# Mineral Oil

- Introduction
	- Extracted from sedimentary rocks. 
	- Primarily consists of 90-95% hydrocarbons, remaining 5-10% made up of organic compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, etc.
- Distribution of global oil reserves
	- ![[Pasted image 20250913131330.png]]
	- Middle East (~48–50%)
		- Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, UAE dominate.
		- Saudi Arabia alone has around 17% of global reserves.
		- This region is the geological jackpot of petroleum due to its vast sedimentary basins
	- South & Central America (~18%)
		- Venezuela holds the single largest proven reserves (~17–18% of the world), though much of it is heavy crude that’s harder and costlier to refine
	- North America (~14%)
		- Canada’s oil sands (Alberta) make up about 10% of global reserves.
	- Africa (~7–8%)
		- Libya, Nigeria, Angola are the big three.
	- Russia (~6%)
		- Russia has around 6% of global reserves
	- Asia-Pacific (~2–3%)
		- Mostly in China, India, and some Southeast Asian countries
- Uneven Distribution of Mineral Oil and its Global Impact
	- Middle East alone holds nearly half of the world's proven oil reserves
	- Geopolitical Power and Conflict: 
		- The concentration of oil gives immense geopolitical leverage to producing nations and creates strategic vulnerabilities for consumers, often leading to conflict.
		- Example
			- The Persian Gulf has been a global hotspot for decades.
			- Gulf Wars, were directly linked to the control and security of oil supplies, showing how oil can be used as a political weapon.
	- Economic Disparity and the 'Resource Curse': 
		- The uneven distribution creates vast economic inequalities. 
		- However, this wealth can lead to the "resource curse," where an over-reliance on oil revenues cripples other sectors of the economy 
		- Example: 
			- Venezuela, despite having the world’s largest oil reserves, saw its economy collapse when oil prices fell, exposing its neglect of other sectors of the economy
	- Uneven Environmental Burden: 
		- The environmental costs of oil are not shared equally. 
		- Producing regions suffer immediate consequences like oil spills, while the climate change effects from oil consumption disproportionately harm vulnerable nations that are not major consumers.
- Oil Production in India
	- India imports around 90% of its crude oil, with significant reliance on Gulf countries and Russia.
	- India's mineral oil production occurs in both on-shore and off-shore locations across the country.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250913133152.png]]
	- On-shore production
		- Extraction of oil and gas from reserves located beneath land.
		- In Northeast India, Assam is a significant producer with its historic Digboi field.
		- In the west, major oilfields are located in Gujarat (Khambhat) while Rajasthan (Barmer region).
	- Off-shore production
		- Extraction of oil and gas from reserves located beneath the seabed.
		- In India it is carried out along both its western and eastern coasts
		- Key Sites: Bombay High, Neelam, Bassein fields, Krishna-Godavari Basin, Cauvery Basin Offshore
		- India has an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of over two million square kilometers where offshore mineral exploration and mining activities are regulated
- Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR)
	- Strategic Petroleum Reserves are massive underground stockpiles of crude oil maintained by the government for emergency situations. 
	- India has established these reserves in large underground rock caverns at locations like Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Mangalore (Karnataka).
	- Energy Security: 
		- They act as a crucial energy buffer, ensuring India has a ready supply of crude oil to fall back on during global crises, such as wars or major supply disruptions, which could otherwise halt the country's economy.
	- Price Stability: 
		- They help the government manage and stabilize domestic fuel prices. 
		- By releasing oil from these reserves during times of high global prices, the government can cushion the public from sudden and extreme price hikes
	- India has limited strategic petroleum reserves compared to other major economies
- Conclusion
	- India is working on diversifying its crude sourcing and increasing bilateral energy trade, especially with the US
