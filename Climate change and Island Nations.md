# Climate change and Island Nations

- Introduction
	- Climate change and the consequent sea-level rise pose an **existential threat** to many low-lying island nations
- Implications
	- Territorial Loss and Coastal Erosion ðŸŒŠ
		- For nations like **Tuvalu**, **Kiribati**, and the **Maldives**, where the average elevation is just a few meters above sea level, even a modest rise can have devastating consequences
		- Several islands have already been lost. For instance, some of the Solomon Islands have completely submerged. 
		- Rising seas, combined with more powerful storm surges, accelerate the erosion of coastlines. 
		- This process shrinks the already limited landmass, destroying homes, infrastructure, and vital ecosystems like mangrove forests
	- Freshwater Scarcity and Food Insecurity ðŸ’§
		- As sea levels rise, saltwater seeps into underground freshwater aquifers, a process known as **salinization**. 
		- These aquifers are often the primary source of drinking water for island populations
		- Once contaminated, they become unusable
		- The salinization of soil renders it infertile, making it impossible to grow staple crops like taro and breadfruit
	- Economic and Social Disruption ðŸ“‰
		- **Damage to Infrastructure:** 
			- Critical infrastructure, including airports, roads, and hospitals, is often located in low-lying coastal areas.
		- **Threat to Tourism and Fisheries:** 
			- Sea-level rise and warming oceans lead to **coral bleaching**, destroying the vibrant reefs that attract tourists and support marine biodiversity.
		- **Forced Migration and Cultural Loss:** 
			- Ultimately, these combined pressures may lead to a point where the islands become uninhabitable, forcing entire populations to migrate.
