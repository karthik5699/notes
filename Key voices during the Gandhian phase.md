## Questions:

1. Many voices had strengthened and enriched the nationalist movement during the Gandhian phase. Elaborate.
2. Since the decade of the 1920s, the national movement acquired various ideological strands and thereby expanded its social base. Discuss.

# Key voices during the Gandhian phase

The _Gandhian phase (1919â€“1947)_ of the Indian national movement was marked by the rise of _mass-based politics_ and _diverse participation_.

- Students
	- Students and young people became a most visible element and played a very important role in mass struggles, especially in movements like the Quit India Movement in 1942
	- Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Bose emerged as prominent leaders of this youth wave, touring the country and advocating against imperialism, capitalism, and landlordism, while preaching socialism
- Peasants
	- Peasant discontent, which had existed in the 19th century, transformed in the 20th century to become deeply intertwined with the national freedom struggle
	- Movements like the Kisan Sabha Movement (e.g., in Awadh from 1918), Eka Movement (United Provinces, 1921), and Bardoli Satyagraha (Gujarat, 1928, led by Vallabhbhai Patel) saw significant peasant participation
	- The formation of the All-India Kisan Sabha in 1936, with Swami Sahajanand as president, consolidated these efforts, mobilizing peasants on issues like rent reduction, abolition of feudal levies, and debt relief
- Working Class
	- The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), founded in 1920 with Lala Lajpat Rai as its first president, played a crucial role in organizing workers
	- Major strikes in the 1920s, such as those in the Bombay Textile Mills, demonstrated the growing strength and political involvement of the working class
- Women: 
	- Gandhi's ideology of non-violence and methods like Satyagraha were seen as 'respectable' & non-threatening allowing women from conservative families to enter the public sphere.
	- Women, traditionally home-centered, began to actively participate in political processions, picketing, and later in trade union and kisan movements.
	- Sarojini Naidu went on to become the president of the Indian National Congress (1925) and later the governor of the United Provinces (1947-49)
	- Women like Aruna Asaf Ali, Usha Mehta, and Sucheta Kriplani played critical roles in organizing mass protests, operating clandestine radio stations, and leading local resistance groups
- Dalits & Backward Castes
	- Movements like the Justice Party (Madras), Self-Respect Movement (led by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in the mid-1920s), and the Mahars under B.R. Ambedkar (Maharashtra, focusing on temple entry and social status) challenged traditional hierarchies
	- Gandhi's Harijan campaign (1930s) aimed to purify Hinduism and Hindu society by eradicating untouchability. This campaign, along with the efforts of leaders like B.R. Ambedkar, contributing to their increasing participation in the national and peasant movements.
- Muslims
	- The Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movements (1920-22) brought urban Muslims into the national movement, fostering a period of significant Hindu-Muslim unity
	- Nationalist Muslims like Mohammad Ali, Abul Kalam Azad became influential
	- However, the communalization of politics after 1922, partly due to the nature of some religious reform movements and the British divide-and-rule policy, later challenged this unity
- Revolutionaries
	- The sudden withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement (1922) disillusioned many young nationalists who had participated actively, leading them to question non-violence and seek alternative, often violent, methods
	- Revolutionary groups like the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and later the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), influenced by socialist ideas and the working class upsurge, began to incorporate socialist objectives into their programs


The influx of these diverse ideological strands and social groups fundamentally transformed the national movement. It led to a more inclusive vision of independent India, emphasizing not just political freedom but also social justice.
