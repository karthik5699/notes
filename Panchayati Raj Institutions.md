## Questions:



# Panchayati Raj Institutions

- Introduction
	- Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) are a cornerstone of democratic decentralization in India
	- The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (1992) accorded constitutional status to PRIs
	- It added Part IX (Articles 243–243O) and the Eleventh Schedule to the Constitution
- Structural Transformation under the 73rd Amendment:
	- Three-Tier System: 
		- The amendment mandated a uniform three-tier structure across states:
			- **Gram Panchayat** at the village level.
			- **Panchayat Samiti** at the block level.
			- **Zila Parishad** at the district level
		- All the 3 levels of PRIs are elected directly by people
	- Gram Sabha: 
		- It established the Gram Sabha as the foundational deliberative body, comprising all adult voters in a village, ensuring a degree of direct democracy
	- Regular Elections and Tenure Security: 
		- The amendment mandated elections every five years and established State Election Commissions (Article 243K)
	- Reservation for Marginalized Groups: 
		- This was a pathbreaking feature, providing mandatory reservations:
			- For Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) based on population.
			- Not less than one-third of all seats for women
				- In her study “Women as Policy Makers,” Esther Duflo finds that women representatives tend to invest more in public goods that align closely with community priorities.
	- Functions
		- The **Eleventh Schedule** listed **29 functional items** (e.g., agriculture, health, education, water supply) to be entrusted to PRIs
	- Financial Empowerment: 
		- State Finance Commissions (SFCs) were introduced to recommend the sharing of financial resources between state governments and PRIs
- Sources of Revenue for PRIs
	- Internal Revenue Generation
		- Local Taxes: Property tax, profession tax, water tax etc.,
		- Non-Tax Revenues: Fees from licenses, building permits, fines
	- Shared Taxes
		- A portion of state taxes (like stamp duty) is devolved to PRIs
	- Grant-in Aid
		- Central Finance Commission Grants (Article 280)
		- State Finance Commission Grants (Article 243-I)
		- Scheme-based Grants (Centrally sponsored schemes)
	- Borrowings
		- PRIs can take loans with the approval of State
- Best Practices:
	- In Rajasthan, Panchayats headed by women saw lesser instances of school dropouts and child marriages. 
	- The Kudumbashree programme, launched in Kerala, has grown into Asia’s largest women’s network for empowerment. 
	- It also plays a significant role in training and capacity-building of women representatives.
- Challenges and Limitations
	- **Incomplete Devolution**: 
		- A major hurdle is the reluctance of state governments to fully transfer functions, functionaries, and funds (the "3Fs") to local bodies
	- Fiscal Dependency: 
		- Local bodies heavily rely on state and central grants, limiting their capacity for revenue generation and developmental autonomy
	- Capacity Deficits: 
		- Lack of administrative training, technical expertise, and infrastructure hinders the effective exercise of authority by local representatives
	- Elite Capture and Persistence of Inequality 
		- Local institutions can still be dominated by existing power structures, with upper-caste, wealthier, and older men often intimidating or excluding women and lower castes
	- Proxy Politics ("Sarpanch Pati"): 
		- Proxy representation, where elected women are controlled by male relatives
- Conclusion
	- In the context of these challenges, initiatives like Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and SWAMITVA represent important steps forward.
