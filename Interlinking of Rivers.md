# Interlinking of Rivers

- Introduction
	- Indiaâ€™s water resources are marked by spatial and temporal imbalances: the Himalayan rivers often experience floods, while peninsular regions face recurrent droughts. 
	- The idea of interlinking rivers (ILR), by transferring water from surplus to deficit basins, aims to address these challenges.
	- In 2021, the Union Cabinet approved the Ken Betwa river link project, which is the first interlinking river project.
- Significance of Interlinking of Rivers
	- Redistributing water flow: 
		- Flood control in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin and drought control and irrigation in the western and peninsular states
	- Hydropower potential: 
		- It would add to the nation's energy pool addressing the electricity woes of industrial, agricultural, and rural households
	- Sustainable development: 
		- It would help address the critical groundwater situation in the country by utilising surface water and preventing the flow of freshwater into the sea.
	- Navigation and trade: 
		- A connected river system would create an inland waterway grid, cutting transport costs and reducing dependence on road/rail.
- Challenges with Interlinking of Rivers
	- Ecological disruption: 
		- Alteration of natural river flows threatens aquatic biodiversity, deltas, and estuarine ecosystems. 
		- For example, reduced silt flow may worsen coastal erosion in the Sundarbans
	- Social displacement: 
		- Large reservoirs and canals could displace millions
	- Federal aspects: 
		- Water is a state subject, and it is difficult to resolve issues of water sharing between states. E.g., Kerala and TN
- Conclusion
	- While ILR appears a grand solution to floods, droughts, and navigation, its ecological, social, and financial costs demand cautious, case-by-case evaluation.
