# Coastal Plains of India

![[Pasted image 20250729160858.png]]

- Introduction
	- Coastal plains are flat, low-lying areas along coastlines, formed by sediment deposition from rivers and oceans
	- As such the coast of India does not offer many sites for good natural harbours.
- East Coast of India
	- Lies between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal
	- It is marked by deltas of rivers like the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Cauvery
	- Chilika lake and the Pulicat lake (lagoon) are the important geographical features of east coast
- West Coast of India
	- ![[Pasted image 20250730150651.png]]
	- The west coast strip extends from the Gulf of Cambay (Gulf of Khambhat) in the north to Cape Comorin (Kanyakumari)
	- The estuaries, of the Narmada and the Tapi are the major ones.
- Coastlines of Emergence and Submergence
	- Coastlines of Emergence: 
		- Formed when land rises relative to sea level, often due to tectonic uplift
		- **L**agoons, salt marshes, beaches, sea cliffs and arches are the typical features of emergence
	- Coastlines of Submergence: 
		- Formed when land sinks or sea level rises, flooding coastal areas
	- Coramandal coast (Tamil Nadu) ==> Coastline of emergence
	- Malabar coast (Kerala Coast) ==> Coastline of emergence
	- Konkan coast (Maharashtra and Goa Coast) ==> Coastline of submergence
- Western Coastal Plains of India
	- Rann of Kachchh in the north to Kanniyakumari in the South.
	- Kutch and Kathiawar region
		- ![[Pasted image 20250730150155.png]]
		- Kutch and Kathiawar, extensions of the Peninsular plateau in Gujarat, are integral to the Western Coastal Plains due to their flat terrain
		- Key features of the region include:
			- Great Rann and Little Rann: The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">salt-soaked plain north of Kutch is the Great Rann</mark>, while its southern continuation, the Little Rann, lies southeast of Kachchh.
			- Kathiawar Peninsula: South of Kachchh, the Kathiawar Peninsula features the Mandav Hills, with radial drainage). Volcanic origin Mt Girnar (1,117 m) is the highest point of Gujarat.
	- Gujarat Plain
		- ![[Pasted image 20250730150842.png]]
		- The Gujarat Plain is situated east of Kachchh and Kathiawar. 
		- Shaped by the rivers Narmada, Tapti, Mahi, and Sabarmati, this plain covers southern Gujarat and the coastal areas of the Gulf of Khambhat.
		- While the eastern part is fertile, most coastal areas are covered by windblown loess, resulting in a semi-arid landscape
	- Konkan Plain
		- ![[Pasted image 20250730151301.png]]
		- The Konkan Plain, located south of the Gujarat Plain, stretches from Daman to Goa
		- This coastal plain, which exhibits marine erosional features, covers Maharashtra and Goa
	- Karnataka Coastal Plain
		- In some places, Western Ghats streams cascade down steep slopes, forming waterfalls. One notable example is the Sharavati River, which forms the Gersoppa (Jog) Falls
	- Kerala (Malabar) Plain
		- The Kerala Plain extends from Mangalore to Kanyakumari.
		- A distinctive feature of the Kerala coast is the presence of lakes, lagoons, backwaters, and spits
		- Backwaters are shallow lagoons or inlets of the sea that run parallel to the coastline. The largest among these is Vembanad Lake.

- Eastern Coastal Plains of India
	- The Eastern Coastal Plains of India stretch from the Subarnarekha River along the WB-Odisha border to Kanyakumari.
	- This plain is known as the Northern Circars between the Mahanadi and the Krishna rivers and as Carnatic between the Krishna and the Cauvery rivers.
	- Much of the eastern plains result from alluvial deposits in the littoral zone by rivers like Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, forming large deltas
	- the sea here is not sufficiently deep, posing challenges for port development
	- Utkal Plain
		- The Utkal Plain comprises the coastal areas of Odisha and includes the Mahanadi Delta.
		- A notable feature of this plain is the Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lake in India.
	- Andhra Plain
		- The Andhra Plain is situated south of the Utkal Plain and extends to Pulicat Lake. Pulicat Lake is blocked by Sriharikota Island, which is used as an ISRO launch site
		- The key feature of this plain is the delta formed by the Godavari and Krishna rivers. The two deltas have merged and formed a single physiographic unit.
		- The Andhra Plain coast is straight and lacks good harbours, except for Vishakhapatnam and Machilipatnam.
	- Tamil Nadu Plain
		- extends from Pulicat Lake to Kanyakumari
		- Its most significant feature is the Cauvery Delta
		- The fertile soil and ample irrigation in the Cauvery delta have made it South India's granary
	- Coromandel Coast or Payan Ghat: The combined region of the Tamil Nadu Coast and parts of the Andhra Coast
- Significance of the Coastal Plains
	- Fertile Soil for Agriculture: 
		- Rice is a major crop grown in these areas. Coconut trees thrive along the coastline.
	- Monazite Reserves: 
		- The sands along the Kerala coast contain significant quantities of monazite, a material used in nuclear power
	- Salt Production: 
		- Low-lying areas in Gujarat are famous for salt production
	- Tourist Destinations: 
		- Beaches and backwaters are significant tourist attractions.
	- Ports for Trade
	- Fishing Industry
