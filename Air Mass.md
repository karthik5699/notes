# Air Mass

- When the air remains over a homogenous area for a sufficiently longer time, it acquires the characteristics of the area. The homogenous regions can be the vast ocean surface or vast plains and plateaus.
- The air with distinctive characteristics in terms of **temperature** and **humidity** is called an air mass. It is a large body of air having **little horizontal variation** in temperature and moisture
- They extend from **surface to lower stratosphere** and are across thousands of kilometers.

- Source regions
	- The homogenous surfaces, over which air masses form, are called the source regions
	- The main source regions are the high pressure belts in the sub tropics (giving rise to tropical air masses) and around the poles (the source for polar air masses).

- Conditions for the formation of Air masses
	- Source region should be extensive with gentle, divergent air circulation
	- Areas with high pressure but little pressure difference or pressure gradient are ideal source regions.
	- There are no major source regions in the mid-latitudes as these regions are dominated by cyclonic and other disturbances.

- Air masses based on Source Regions
	- ![[Pasted image 20250708171225.png]]
	- There are five major source regions
		- Warm tropical and subtropical oceans - Maritime tropical (mT)
		- The subtropical hot deserts - Continental tropical (cT)
		- The relatively cold high latitude oceans - Maritime polar (mP)
		- The very cold snow covered continents in high latitudes - Continental polar (cP)
		- Permanently ice covered continents in the Arctic and Antarctica - Continental arctic (cA)

- Cold Air Mass
	- A cold air mass is one which is colder than the underlying surface and is associated with instability and atmospheric turbulence
	- Cold source regions (polar air masses)
		- Arctic Ocean – cold and moist
		- Siberia – cold and dry
		- Northern Canada – cold and dry
- Warm Air Mass
	- A warm air mass is one which is warmer than the underlying surface and is associated with stable weather conditions
	- Warm source regions (tropical air masses)
		- Sahara Desert – warm and dry
		- Tropical Oceans – warm and moist

- Influence of Air Masses on World Weather
	- The air masses carry atmospheric moisture from oceans to continents and cause precipitation over landmasses
	- They transport **latent heat**, thus removing the latitudinal heat balance
	- Most of the migratory atmospheric disturbances such as cyclones and storms originate at the **contact zone** between different air masses and the weather associated with these disturbances is determined by characteristics of the air masses involved

Classification of Air Masses
- Broadly, the air masses are classified into polar and tropical air masses.
- Both the polar and the continental air masses can be either of maritime or continental types.
- Continental Polar Air Masses (CP)
	- Source regions of these air masses are the Arctic basin, northern North America, Eurasia and Antarctica.
	- These air masses are characterized by dry, cold and stable conditions
- Maritime Polar Air Masses (MP)
	- The source region of these air masses are the oceans between 40° and 60° latitudes
	- These are actually those continental polar air masses which have moved over the warmer oceans, got heated up and have collected moisture
	- The conditions over the source regions are cool, moist and unstable
- Continental Tropical Air Masses (CT)
	- The source-regions of the air masses include tropical and sub-tropical deserts of Sahara in Africa, and of West Asia and Australia.
	- These air masses are dry, hot and stable and do not extend beyond the source
- Maritime Tropical Air Masses (MT)
	- The source regions of these air masses include the oceans in tropics and sub-tropics such as Mexican Gulf, the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans
	- These air masses are warm, humid and unstable
