# Lakes
![[Pasted image 20250722152011.png]]

- Introduction
	- A lake is a body of water of considerable size, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land apart from a river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.
	- Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake’s average level by allowing the drainage of excess water
	- Other lakes are found in endorheic basins. Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage or both. They are termed endorheic lakes.
	- The majority of lakes on Earth are fresh water, and most lie in the Northern Hemisphere at higher latitudes. Canada, Finland and Siberia contain most of the fresh water lakes.
- Classification of Lakes
	- Temporary lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722152435.png]]
		- Lakes may exist temporarily filling up the small depressions of undulating ground after a heavy shower
		- In this kind of lakes, Evaporation > Precipitation
	- Permanent lakes
		- In this kind of lakes, Evaporation < Precipitation.
		- Example: Great Lakes of North America, East African Rift Lakes
	- Fresh water lakes
		- Most of the lakes in the world are fresh-water lakes fed by rivers and with out-flowing streams e.g. Great Lakes of North America
	- Saline lakes
		- Salt lakes (also called saline lakes) can form where there is no natural outlet or where the water evaporates rapidly 
		- Examples of salt lakes include Great Salt Lake, the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea.
		- Playas or salt lakes, are a common feature of deserts
			- ![[Pasted image 20250722152855.png]]
- Lakes Formed by Earth Movement
	- Tectonic lakes
		- Due to the warping (simple deformation), subsidence (sliding downwards), bending and fracturing (splitting) of the earth’s crust, tectonic depressions occur. 
		- Such depressions give rise to lakes of immense sizes and depths.
		- They include Lake Titicaca, and the Caspian Sea.
	- Rift valley lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722153923.png]]
		- A rift valley is formed when two blocks of earth move apart letting the ‘in between’ block slide downwards. Or, it’s a sunken land between two parallel faults.
		- Rift valleys are deep, narrow and elongated. Hence the lakes formed along rift valleys are also deep, narrow and very long.
		- The best known example is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">East African Rift Valley which runs through Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia</mark>, and extends along the Red Sea to Israel and Jordan over a total distance of 3,000 miles.

- Lakes Formed by Glaciation
	- Cirque Lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722145457.png]]
		- Hollow basin cut into a mountain ridge.
		- When the ice melts, the cirque may develop into a tarn lake.
- Lakes Formed by Volcanic Activity
	- Crater and Caldera lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250630145527.png]]
		- In dormant or extinct volcanoes, rain falls straight into the crater or caldera which has no superficial outlet and forms a crater or caldera lake
		- E.g. Lonar in Maharashtra
- Lakes and Man
	- Besides the natural lakes, man has now created artificial lakes by erecting a concrete dam across a river valley so that the river water can be kept back to form reservoirs.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250722154904.png]]
	- In countries where they are found in abundance, such as Finland, Canada, U.S.A., Sweden and the East African states, lakes are used as inland waterways.
	- Large lakes like the Great Lakes of North America provide a cheap and convenient form of transport for heavy and bulky goods such as coal, iron, machinery, grains and timber.
	- Bhakra Nangal Dam. Its reservoir, known as the “Gobind Sagar Lake” and Hirakud Dam (Odisha) on the Mahanadi in India.

- Important Lakes on Earth
	- ![[Pasted image 20250722160122.png]]
	- Note
		- Black Sea is not a lake (it is a [[Marginal Seas]]) since Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits connect it to the Mediterranean Sea
		- Caspian Sea and Dead Sea are lakes.
	- Lake Tanganyika – Longest Lake
	- The world’s highest commercially navigable lake is Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia border at 3,812 m. It is also the largest lake in South America.
	- The world’s lowest lake is the Dead Sea, bordering Israel and Jordan. It is also one of the lakes with highest salt concentration.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722160744.png]]
	- Great Lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722160846.png]]
		- Great Lakes of North America are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes
		- Lake Superior is the **largest continental lake** in the world by area, and Lake **Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country**
	- Aral Sea
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722161518.png]]
		- It was a lake lying between Kazakhstan in the north and Uzbekistan, in the south.
		- Aral Sea has been steadily shrinking since the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects.
	- African Great Lakes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722161948.png]]
		- Series of lakes constituting the part of the Rift Valley lakes in and around the East African Rift
		- They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world, through which Equator passes
