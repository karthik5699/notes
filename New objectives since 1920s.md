## Questions:

1. Highlight the importance of the new objectives that got added to the vision of Indian independence since twenties of the last century.

# New objectives since 1920s

The 1920s marked a crucial ideological and strategic shift in India’s freedom movement. The initial goal of _political freedom from British rule_ gradually expanded to encompass broader _social, economic, and constitutional_ aspirations.

1. Complete Independence (Purna Swaraj): 
	- This became the explicit and central goal of the Indian National Congress, shifting from the earlier demand for dominion status
2. Socialist Ideology
	- In the late 1920s and l930s socialist ideas acquired roots in the Indian soil; and socialism became the accepted creed of Indian youth whose urges came to be symbolised by Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose. 
		- Gradually there emerged two powerful parties of the Left, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Congress Socialist Party (CSP).
	- One aspect of this was the effort to organize the peasants in kisan sabhas, the workers in trade unions and the youth in youth leagues and student unions
	- There was a push for the nationalization of key industries like railways and heavy industries
3. Deepening of Democratic Ideals
	- Universal adult suffrage was demanded for all adult men and women
	- Gandhiji’s commitment to civil liberties was also total. At the height of the Non-Cooperation Movement, he wrote in the Young India in January 1922: 
		- ‘Swaraj, the Khilafat, the Punjab occupy a subordinate place to the issue sprung upon the country by the Government. We must first make good the right of free speech and free association before we can make any further progress towards our goal . . . We must defend these elementary rights with our lives.’ 
4. Global Anti-Imperial Solidarity
	- Influenced by global events like the Russian Revolution, Indian leaders (especially Left groups) began to connect Indian freedom with **global struggles against imperialism**, broadening the vision beyond national borders.


These expanded objectives laid the ideological foundation of post-independence nation-building and ensured the freedom struggle was not merely political, but civilisational.
