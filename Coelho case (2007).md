## Questions:

1. What was held in the Coelho case? In this context, can you say that judicial review is of key importance amongst the basic features of the Constitution?

# Coelho case (2007)

- Introduction
	- The primary question before the nine-judge bench in the Coelho case was whether statutes, once inserted into the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution could be exempt from judicial review. 
	- The Ninth Schedule, created by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, through Article 31B, was initially intended to shield land reform legislation from judicial scrutiny, making laws placed within it immune from challenges based on fundamental rights.
	- However, over time, it came to include many statutes unrelated to land reform
- The Supreme Court held the following:
	- The court established a twofold test for all amendments seeking to insert legislation into the Ninth Schedule
		- Did they conform with the basic structure of the Constitution?
		- Did they conform with the fundamental rights as forming a part of the basic structure of the Constitution?
	- The court unanimously concluded that the government could not wantonly exploit the Ninth Schedule as the "black hole" of the Constitution
	- The Coelho judgment upheld the authority of the judiciary to review any law, including those placed in the Ninth Schedule after April 14, 1973 (Kesavananda Bharati case)
- Conclusion
	- Thus, the ability of the judiciary to review legislative and executive actions, as highlighted by the Coelho case, is integral to preserving the fundamental principles of the Indian Constitution.
