# Article 21

- Introduction
	- Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law"
	- It forms a crucial part of the 'golden triangle' of fundamental rights, alongside Articles 14 (Equality before law) and 19 (Right to Freedom).
- Interpretation and Impact:
	- Original Intent 
		- During the formulation of the Indian Constitution, there was a profound debate on whether Article 21 should use "procedure established by law" (borrowed from Japan) or "due process of law" (American concept). 
		- The framers ultimately chose "procedure established by law," intending for courts to examine only the procedural adequacy of laws, not their substantive merit 
	- Early Interpretation
		- In the 1950 case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, the Supreme Court adopted a rigid interpretation
		- If a law was suitably passed and enacted, courts were not allowed to question it, no matter how arbitrary or oppressive
	- Breathing Life into Article 21 (Maneka Gandhi Case)
		- The rigid approach of Gopalan was fully overturned in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978)
		- The Maneka Gandhi judgment transformed Article 21 by holding that any "procedure established by law" must be "fair, just and reasonable". 
		- This effectively introduced the concept of substantive due process into Indian constitutional law
		- The Court gave the expression "personal liberty" under Article 21 the widest amplitude, covering a variety of rights. 
		- It affirmed that the right to travel abroad fell within the sweep of personal liberty under Article 21
	- Broadening Scope: Unenumerated Rights and Judicial Activism
		- Following Maneka Gandhi, Article 21 became a repository of human rights
		- Right to livelihood
			- In Olga Tellis case (1985), the Supreme Court affirmed that the right to life includes the (second generation) right to livelihood.
		- Environmental Rights: 
			- Courts have included the right to clean air, pollution-free water, and a clean environment within Article 21
		- Protection of Women and Children: 
			- Also derived from Article 21
		- Right to Health and Medical Care: 
			- Included within the ambit of Article 21
		- Right to Education: 
			- Right to free and compulsory education as a fundamental right derived from Article 21
		- Right to Privacy: 
			- In Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India (2017), the Supreme Court declared the right to privacy under Article 21. 
				- It includes the preservation of personal intimacies, sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, home, and sexual orientation. 
			- It didn’t say privacy is **absolute**. 
			- It laid down certain conditions under which the State can lawfully restrict the right to privacy
				- 3-fold test
					- Legality
						- There must be a law that authorizes the restriction on privacy.
					- Legitimate Aim
						- The law must pursue a legitimate state interest.
						- E.g. National interest, prevention of crime
					- Proportionality
						- The restriction must be necessary and proportionate to achieve the aim.
			- This ruling was instrumental in other landmark judgments like decriminalizing consensual same-sex relations (Navtej Singh Johar)
		- Right to Choose Gender Identity: 
			- In NALSA v. Union of India (2014), the right to choose one's gender identity was recognized as integral to to lead a life of dignity under Article 21
		- Right to Die with Dignity: 
			- The Common Cause v. Union of India (2018) case
				- The right to die with dignity is a fundamental right under Article 21.
				- Passive euthanasia can be allowed in case of permanent vegetative state on the basis of 'advance directive' or 'living will' of patient
				- The reasoning is that dignity must be preserved not only in life but also in the process of dying.
			- Case Laws Chronology
				- P. Rathinam (1994) {Right to life also includes right to die} → Gian Kaur (1996) {Right to life does not include right to die} → Aruna Shanbaug (2011) {Passive euthanasia allowed case-by-case} → Common Cause (2018) {_right to die with dignity_ as part of Article 21}
- Emergency and Article 21
	- During the National Emergency, the ADM Jabalpur case (1976) controversially restricted Article 21, holding that no person had locus standi to move a writ petition for habeas corpus during an Emergency
	- The 44th Amendment Act (1978)
		- Article 20 and 21 were made non-suspendable even during emergency
- Conclusion
	- In essence, Article 21 has evolved from a limited procedural safeguard to a comprehensive guarantee encompassing a wide array of human rights and personal liberties, signifying a dynamic interpretation of the Constitution
