# Economic Planning in India

- Introduction
	- Economic planning is the process by which a central authority formulates a set of targets to be achieved within a specific period, keeping the country's needs and resources in view. 
	- The market mechanism prioritizes high-profit activities, whereas planning allows for the systematic utilization of available resources to rapidly build the nation's productive capacity.
- Need for planning in New Independent India
	- When the British left India in 1947 there were many challenges
		- Illiteracy
		- Food shortage and inflation
		- Mass poverty
		- Weak Private Sector
	- Inspired by Russian experience, planning as an instrument of economic development was adopted to tackle these challenges
- Types of planning
	- The nature of planning can be broadly categorized based on the degree of state control
		- Imperative --> Top down, centralised --> State sets targets and allocates resources --> Socialist economies
		- Indicative --> Guiding, incentivising --> State sets broad objectives and guides the private sector --> Mixed economies
		- Structural --> Long-term intervention --> Changing the structural composition (agriculture to industry) --> Transforming economy
	- India's Five-Year Plans incorporated elements of both indicative and structural planning.
- The Five-Year Plan (FYP) Era
	- From 1951 to 2017, India's development trajectory was guided by the Five-Year Plans (FYPs), formulated by the Planning Commission. 
	- This era was defined by the Nehru-Mahalanobis strategy, which prioritized heavy industrialization and a dominant public sector to build a self-reliant economy.
	- Key achievements
		- Industrial diversification
			- Key sectors like power and capital goods were developed under PSUs
		- Rise in savings and investments
			- Both gross domestic savings and rate of investment grew substantially
		- Human Capital Formation
		- Food Security
	- Shortcomings
		- Concerns regarding Federalism
			- Planning Commission often overstepped its authority leading to resentment among states
			- Indicative planning became prescriptive planning
		- Inefficiency and License Raj
		- Neglect of Agriculture and Exports
		- Ineffective land reforms
		- Fiscal imbalances
- 10 Years of NITI Aayog
	- The move to establish NITI Aayog was driven by the belief that the centralized, top-down planning model of the Commission was obsolete in a liberalized and globalized Indian economy
		- The Planning Commission was often seen as a relic of a command-and-control economy, functioning as a "super-cabinet"
		- Its one-size-fits-all approach was considered ill-suited for a diverse nation with states at varying levels of development.
	- NITI Aayog: Structure and Principles
		- NITI Aayog was envisioned as a policy think tank or an advisory body to the government, fundamentally different from its predecessor.
		- Structure
			- Chairperson --> PM of India
			- Governing Council --> Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, Lt. Governors, Ex-Officio members, Full-time members, Special Invitees
			- Regional Councils --> Formed for specified tenure to address specific issues impacting multiple states
		- Objectives
			- Cooperative Federalism
				- Fostering collaboration between states for national development
			- Policy Formulation
				- Designing and monitoring strategic policies
				- Focuses on long-term policy and program frameworks (e.g., 15-year vision, 7-year strategy, 3-year action agenda).
			- Knowledge and Innovation
				- To be a repository of research on good governance and best practices
			- Inter-departmental collaboration
	- NITI Aayog – Evaluation of its working
		- A decade after its formation, the performance of NITI Aayog has been described as underwhelming. 
		- While NITI Aayog has initiated several programmes and released various vision documents, its tangible impact on policy has been limited.
		- Important Achievements of NITI Aayog
			- Enhanced Cooperative Federalism: 
				- NITI Aayog served as a linking bridge between central and state governments, fostering collaboration to align regional priorities with national goals.
				- E.g. Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP), aiming to transform 112 under-developed districts across the country with close collaboration between line Ministries and development partners.
			- Strengthened Competitive Federalism: 
				- Encouraged healthy competition among states through data-driven and transparent indexes and ranking systems.
				- E.g., Fiscal Health Index
			- Governance and Policy Advice: 
				- As a think tank, NITI Aayog advised on long-term strategic policies and shifted focus from financial allocation (priority of the erstwhile Planning Commission) to policy advisory, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">promoting a decentralised governance approach.</mark>
				- E.g., it assisted states in setting up State Institutions of Transformation (SITs) for better governance and policy implementation.
			- Inculcated Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Digital Transformation:
				- Through initiatives like Atal Innovation Mission (Atal Tinkering Labs, Atal Incubation Centre), Knowledge and Innovation Hub and the roadmap for digital payments
			- Regional and Inter-Sectoral Social Interventions:
				- E.g., NITI Forum for North East, SATH-E initiative, Poshan Abhiyan, State Health Index, School Education Quality Index
			- Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Monitoring: 
				- Tasked with monitoring and adopting SDGs in India 
				- E.g., SDG India Index.
		- Challenges faced by NITI Aayog
			- Lack of Budgetary Powers: 
				- Unlike the Planning Commission, NITI Aayog has no financial authority
				- This significantly weakens its ability to engage in meaningful dialogue with states and enforce its policy recommendations.
			- Advisory Role: 
				- Its recommendations are not binding on ministries or state governments
				- E.g. Its Vision documents like "India@75" and the "Three-Year Action Agenda" failed to have a significant policy impact
			- Centralised Structure: 
				- Despite its mandate for cooperative federalism, NITI Aayog’s structure remains centralised, and state cooperation varies
			- Perceived Constraints on Autonomy: 
				- NITI Aayog's integration within the government can lead to perceptions of limited independence in providing unbiased policy advice.
			- Inter-Ministerial Coordination
				- Difficulty in aligning specific ministry budgets with NITI Aayog's long-term vision documents
	- Way forward
		- To evolve into a more effective institution (NITI Aayog 2.0), several reforms are necessary:
			- Grant Statutory status
				- Giving NITI Aayog statutory status and a Cabinet Minister rank for its leadership to ensure its advice is integrated government decision-making
			- Limited Financial Influence
				- Empower with limited budgetary powers to incentivise states
			- Strengthen Research Capacity
				- Bolster in-house research to reduce dependence on external consultants
			- Enhance Cooperative Federalism
				- Improve coordination with states and actively address regional imbalances
	- Conclusion
		- To enhance its impact, NITI Aayog must evolve into a more empowered institution with greater financial autonomy, resource allocation and stronger policy enforcement mechanisms
- Conclusion
	- To tackle complex challenges from inequality to climate change, a revamped, data-driven, and forward-looking planning approach is essential for India's 2047 goals, a capacity still largely missing.
