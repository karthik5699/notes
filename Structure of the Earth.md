# Structure of the Earth

- The interior of the earth is made up of several concentric layers of which the crust, the mantle, the outer core and the inner core are significant because of their unique physical and chemical properties

- The Crust
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">outermost layer of the earth making up 0.5-1.0 per cent of the earth’s volume and less than 1 per cent of Earth’s mass</mark>
	- Density increases with depth
	- The thickness of the crust varies in the range of range of 5-30 km in case of the oceanic crust and as 50-70 km in case of the continental crust.
	- The outer covering of the crust is of **sedimentary material** and below that lie crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks which are acidic in nature.
	- The continents are composed of lighter silicates — silica + aluminium (also called sial) while the oceans have the heavier silicates — silica + magnesium (also called sima)
	- The continental crust is composed of lighter (felsic) rocks, like granite.
	- The oceanic crust, on the other hand, is composed of dense (mafic) rocks, like basalt.
	- Most abundant elements of Earth's crust:
		- Oxygen >> Silicon >> Aluminium >> Iron
	- Most abundant elements of Earth:
		- Iron >> Oxygen >> Silicon >> Magnesium
- Lithosphere
	- The lithosphere is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">rigid outer part of the earth</mark> with thickness varying between 10-200 km.
	- It is <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle</mark>
	- The<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates</mark> (lithospheric plates), and the movement of these tectonic plates cause large-scale changes in the earth’s geological structure (folding, faulting).
	- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat as well as the radioactive decay</mark> of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth’s crust and mantle.
- The Mantle
	- It forms about 83% of the earth’s volume and holds 67% of the earth’s mass.
	- It <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">extends from Moho’s discontinuity to a depth of 2,900 km</mark>
	- The upper portion of the mantle is called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">asthenosphere</mark>
		- It is the main source of magma that finds its way to the surface during volcanic eruptions
	- The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust
	- In the mantle, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">temperatures range from approximately 200 °C at the upper boundary with the crust to approximately 4,000 °C at the core-mantle boundary</mark>.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Because of the temperature difference, there is a convective material circulation in the mantle </mark>
	- Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates
- The Outer Core
	- The outer core, surrounding the inner core, lies between 2900 km and 5100 km below the earth’s surface
	- The outer core is composed of iron mixed with nickel (nife)
	- The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid, so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to the inner core
	- The temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 °C in the outer regions to 6000 °C near the inner core
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Dynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core + Coriolis effect = Earth’s magnetic field</mark>
- The Inner Core
	- The inner core extends from the centre of the earth to 5100 km below the earth’s surface
	- The inner core is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron (80%) and some nickel (nife)
	- The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field.
	- The core (inner core and the outer core) accounts for just about 16% of the earth’s volume but 33% of earth’s mass
- Seismic Discontinuities
	- The regions in the earth where seismic waves behave a lot different compared to the surrounding regions due to a marked change in physical or chemical properties.
	- Moho's Discontinuity: separates the crust from the mantle.
	- Asthenosphere: highly viscous, mechanically weak and ductile part of mantle.
	- Gutenberg Discontinuity: lies between the mantle and the outer core.




## Personal Analysis:

Felsic refers to rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium.

It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron.
