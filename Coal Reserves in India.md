# Coal Reserves in India

- Introduction
	- Coal accounts for 55% of India's energy needs and fuels 75% of power generation.
	- India is the 2nd largest coal consumer and importer globally.
- Importance of Coal in India
	- Energy Security: 
		- Coal is critical for meeting India's energy demands and ensuring energy security.
	- Socioeconomic Relevance: 
		- Coal mining supports regional development and employment, especially in states like Jharkhand, Odisha, and Bihar
- Problems related to coal in India
	- Shortage of High-Grade Coking Coal: 
		- India lacks sufficient high-grade coking coal, essential for the steel industry, leading to imports from Australia, Canada, South Africa, and Indonesia
		- Indian coal has high ash content and low caloric value, causing significant pollution when burned
	- Deep Mining Techniques: 
		- Lack of advanced deep mining technology leads to high casualties and inefficiencies.
- Government Initiatives and Reforms
	- Modernisation and Sustainability: 
		- India is adopting a multi-pronged strategy to modernise the coal sector, including afforestation of mined-out areas, treated mine water utilization, and blast-free mining technologies.
	- Emission Reduction: 
		- Implementation of technologies like Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD), Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP), and biomass co-firing to reduce emissions from thermal power plants.
	- Coal Gasification: 
		- The government aims to gasify 100 million tonnes of coal by 2030 to produce synthetic gas for cleaner energy
	- Import Substitution: 
		- Policies to enhance domestic coal production, faster clearance of coal blocks, private sector participation, and improved coal transportation infrastructure
