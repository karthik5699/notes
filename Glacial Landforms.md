# Glacial Landforms

- Introduction
	- A glacier is a moving mass of ice at speeds averaging few meters a day.
	- Glaciers form on land, and they are made up of fallen snow that gets compressed into ice over many centuries
	- They move slowly downward from the pull of gravity.
	- Types of Glaciers
		- Continental Glaciers
			- Are found in the Antarctica and in Greenland
		- Ice caps 
			- Are the covers of snow and ice on mountains from which the valley or mountain glaciers originate
		- Piedmont glaciers 
			- ![[Pasted image 20250722144839.png]]
			- Form a continuous ice sheet at the base of mountains as in southern Alaska
		- Valley glaciers 
			- ![[Pasted image 20250722145000.png]]
			- also known as Alpine glaciers, are found in higher regions of the Himalayas in our country and all such high mountain ranges of the world
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A glacier carries rock debris, which it uses to erode the landscape as it moves</mark>
	- A glacier during its lifetime creates various landforms which may be classified into erosional and depositional landforms
- Glacial Erosional Landforms
	- ![[Pasted image 20250722145342.png]]
	- Cirque
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722145457.png]]
		- Hollow basin cut into a mountain ridge.
		- When the ice melts, the cirque may develop into a tarn lake.
	- Glacial Trough
		- Original stream-cut valley, further modified by glacial action.
		- It is a ‘U’ Shaped Valley. It at mature stage of valley formation.
	- Hanging Valley
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722145827.png]]
		- Formed when smaller tributaries are unable to cut as deeply as bigger ones and remain ‘hanging’ at higher levels than the main valley as discordant tributaries
	- D-Fjord
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722150022.png]]
		- A fjord is a long, narrow, deep inlet of the sea with steep sides or cliffs, typically formed by glacial erosion
		- Fjords are common in Norway, Greenland and New Zealand
- Glacial Depositional Landforms

-----

- Why are world’s highest mountains at the equator?
	- Ice and glacier coverage at lower altitudes in cold climates is more important than collision of tectonic plates. 
	- Glacial erosion is very strong because of huge boulders of rocks carried by the glacial ice that graze the surface. 
	- Though ice moves only few meters a day, it can take along it huge rocks that can peal the outer layers.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Colder climates are better at eroding peaks. </mark>
	- In colder climates, the snow line on mountains starts lower down, and erosion takes place at lower altitudes.
	- In general, mountains only rise to around 1,500m above their snow lines, so it is the altitude of these lines — which depends on climate and latitude — which ultimately decides their height.
	- At low latitudes, the atmosphere is warm and the snow line is high. 
	- Around the equator, the snow line is about 5,500m at its highest so mountains get up to 7,000m.
