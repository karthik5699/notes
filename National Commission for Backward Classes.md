## Questions:

1. Discuss the role of the National Commission for Backward Classes in the wake of its transformation from a statutory body to a constitutional body.

# National Commission for Backward Classes

- Introduction
	- The **102nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018**, transformed the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) from a statutory body to a constitutional body under **Article 338B**, fundamentally altering its role and empowering it as a guardian for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs).
- Key transformations in its role are:
	- From an Advisory Body to a Quasi-Judicial Watchdog:
		- The most significant change is that the NCBC is now vested with the **powers of a civil court**. 
		- It can investigate and inquire into specific complaints regarding the violation of rights and deprivation of safeguards of SEBCs.
		- This is a major leap from its earlier, largely recommendatory function of examining requests for inclusion or exclusion of castes from reservation lists.
	- Expanded Mandate and Monitoring Functions
		- The NCBC is now responsible for investigating and monitoring all matters related to constitutional and legal safeguards for SEBCs and evaluating their implementation.
	- Enhanced Autonomy and Institutional Weight:
		- As a constitutional body, its reports are now presented to the President, who tables them before Parliament. 
		- This brings its functioning on par with the National Commissions for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and Scheduled Tribes (NCST), giving its recommendations greater weight and making them difficult for the executive to ignore.
	- Mandatory Consultative Role:
		- The Union and State governments are now obligated to consult the NCBC on all major policy matters affecting the SEBCs, ensuring their voice is integrated into the policy-making process
- Conclusion
	- In essence, the transformation has elevated the NCBC from a limited-purpose advisory body to an empowered constitutional authority with a comprehensive mandate for the protection, welfare, and development of backward classes.
	- 2nd ARC report suggested that instead of having multiple separate commissions (for SCs, STs, BCs, Women, Minorities), the government should create a unified and powerful **"National Authority for Human Rights"** by merging them.
