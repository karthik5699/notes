# Volcanic Landforms

- Volcanic landforms are divided into **extrusive and intrusive landforms** based on whether magma cools within the crust or above the crust.
- Rocks formed by the cooling of magma within the crust are called Plutonic rocks
- Rocks formed by the cooling of lava above the surface are called Igneous rocks

- #### Extrusive Volcanic Landforms
	- Formed from material thrown out to the surface during volcanic activity.
	- The materials thrown out include lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash, dust and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon
	- Conical Vent and Fissure Vent
		- ![[Pasted image 20250630143639.png]]
		- Conical vent
			- A narrow cylindrical vent through which magma flows out violently
			- Conical vents are common in composite volcanism (stratovolcano)
		- Fissure Vent
			- A narrow, linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity
			- Fissure vents are common in basaltic volcanism (shield type volcanoes).
	- Mid-Ocean Ridges
		- These volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas
		- The system of mid-ocean ridges stretches for more than 70,000 km across all the ocean basins
		- The lava is basaltic (less silica and hence less viscous) and causes the spreading of the seafloor
	- Composite Volcanoes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250708165556.png]]
		- Characterised by eruptions of cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt. 
		- These volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions. 
		- Along with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic material and ashes find their way to the ground. 
		- This material accumulates in the vicinity of the vent openings leading to formation of layers, and this makes the mounts appear as composite volcanoes.
		- Mount Stromboli (the Lighthouse of ???), Mount Vesuvius, Mount Fuji are examples
	- Shield Volcanoes
		- ![[Pasted image 20250708165704.png]]
		- Barring the basalt flows, the shield volcanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth
		- These volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted. 
		- For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep. 
		- They become explosive if somehow water gets into the vent; otherwise, they are characterised by low explosivity
		- The **Hawaiian volcanoes** are the most familiar examples.
	- Caldera
		- ![[Pasted image 20250708170003.png]]
		- These are the most explosive of the earthâ€™s volcanoes. 
		- They are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. 
		- The collapsed depressions are called calderas
	- Flood Basalt Provinces
		- ![[Pasted image 20250708170135.png]]
		- These volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances. 
		- Some parts of the world are covered by thousands of sq. km of thick basalt lava flows.
		- The Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province
	- Crater
		- An inverted cone-shaped vent through which the magma flows out. When the volcano is not active the crater appears as a bowl-shaped depression.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250630145241.png]]
		- When water from rain or melted snow gets accumulated in the crater, it becomes a crater lake
		- Lake Toba (Indonesia) is the largest crater lake in the world
		- Lonar Lake, also known as Lonar crater (Maharashtra) was created by a meteor impact

#### Intrusive Volcanic Landforms
- Formed when magma cools within the crust
- Batholiths
	- A large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depth of the crust develops in the form of large domes.
	- They appear on the surface only after the denudation processes remove the overlying materials
	- Batholiths form the core of huge mountains
- Laccoliths
	- These are large dome-shaped intrusive bodies connected by a pipe-like conduit from below
	- The Karnataka plateau is spotted with dome hills of granite rocks. Most of these, now exfoliated, are examples of laccoliths or batholiths
- Lapolith
	- As and when the lava moves upwards, a portion of the same may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a weak plane.
	- In case it develops into a saucer shape, it is called Lapolith
- Sills
	- The near horizontal bodies of the intrusive igneous rocks are called sill.
- Dykes
	- When the lava makes its way through cracks and the fissures developed in the land, it solidifies almost perpendicular to the ground. 
	- It gets cooled in the same position to develop a wall-like structure. 
	- Such structures are called dykes. 
	- These are the most commonly found intrusive forms in the western Maharashtra area.
	- These are considered the **feeders for the eruptions** that led to the development of the **Deccan traps**.
