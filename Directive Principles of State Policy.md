# Directive Principles of State Policy

- Introduction
	- The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), enshrined in Part IV (Articles 36–51) of the Indian Constitution, articulate a vision of a social and economic democracy
	- They represent the **normative aspirations** and **social conscience** of the Constitution
- Nature and Constitutional Position
	- The makers of the Constitution knew that India was going to face many challenges--equality and well-being--and they also thought that policy direction was required for handling these problems
	- At the same time, the Constitution did not want future governments to be bound by certain policy decisions.
	- Therefore, some guidelines were incorporated in the Constitution, but they were made non-justiciable.
	- However, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Article 37 explicitly states that they are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws</mark>.
	- They embody constitutional morality in action.
- Historical Context
	- **Karachi Resolution (1931):** 
		- They can be traced back to the 1931 Karachi Resolution, which emphasized the State's positive obligations to provide for the social and economic well-being of its people
	- Influences: 
		- The concept of DPSPs was notably borrowed from the Irish Constitution
- Key Provisions and their Developmental Implications
	- Social and Economic Justice:
		- Article 38: Promoting welfare and reducing inequalities
		- Article 39: Ensuring equitable distribution of resources and livelihood rights, preventing the concentration of wealth, and promoting equal pay for equal work
		- Article 39A: Providing equal justice and free legal aid to the poor
		- Article 46: Directs the state to promote the educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and other weaker sections
	- Non-justiciable Rights:
		- Articles 41: Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases
		- Article 42: Provision for just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief
		- Article 43: Living wage, etc., for workers
		- Article 45: Provision for early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years
		- Article 47: Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health
		- Article 48A: Mandates the state to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife
	- Democratic Governance
		- Article 40: Organization of village panchayats as units of self-government
		- Article 43A: Participation of workers in the management of industries
		- Article 43B: Promotion of co-operative societies
		- Article 44: Uniform Civil Code
- Interrelationship with Fundamental Rights
	- It is possible to see both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles as complementary to each other.
	- Fundamental Rights restrain the government from doing certain things while Directive Principles exhort the government to do certain things.
	- However, at times when government intends to implement Directive Principles of State policy, it can come in conflict with the Fundamental Rights
	- Case laws
		- _Champakam Dorairajan case (1951) 
			- Supreme Court held that Fundamental Rights would prevail over DPSPs in case of conflict
		- *Minerva Mills case (1980)* 
			- SC declared that both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are essential features of the Constitution and must be harmonised
			- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Part III and Part IV constitute 2 wheels of a chariot </mark>
		- Harmonious Construction and Rights Expansion: 
			- The judiciary has played a crucial role in giving DPSPs quasi-enforceability by interpreting Fundamental Rights through their lens
				- In Olga Tellis case (1985), Right to livelihood (Article 39) was derived from the Right to Life (Article 21)
				- The right to education (Article 41) was read into Article 21 in Unni Krishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh (1993), later codified as Article 21A
				- Environmental jurisprudence (e.g., polluter pays, precautionary principle) has been built upon Article 48A in cases like MC Mehta and Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum case (1996)
- Impact on Welfare-Oriented Governance and Policy
	- Policy and Planning Framework: 
		- DPSPs have informed India's planning philosophy, from the Five-Year Plans to NITI Aayog Vision Documents
	- Social Legislation: 
		- They provide normative justification for progressive legislation in labor, environment, education, and public health
		- E.g. MGNREGA, NFSA
	- Local Self-Governance: 
		- Article 40, a DPSP on village panchayats, was concretized by the 73rd and 74th Amendments
	- Transformative Constitutionalism: 
		- Contemporary scholarship views DPSPs as instruments of transformative constitutionalism
- Relevance in the Post-1991 Liberalization Era
	- The 1991 economic liberalization, emphasizing market-led growth and deregulation, raised critical questions about the DPSPs' survival in a market-driven economy
	- Far from becoming obsolete, DPSPs have been invoked, adapted, and contested in discourses on inclusive growth, welfare guarantees, and social equity
	- The 2000s saw a return to DPSP-inspired welfare through rights-based legislation like the Right to Education Act (2009), National Food Security Act (2013), and MGNREGA (2005), which operationalized DPSP mandates
-  Limitations and Challenges
	- Implementing many DPSPs requires vast financial investment, making their realization contingent on state capacity
	- Governments have often prioritized certain DPSPs (e.g., industrial development) while neglecting others (e.g., Uniform Civil Code) leading to partial realization of the constitutional vision
	- The broad phrasing of some directives can dilute their operational specificity, leading to policy vagueness or populist co-optation
	- While judicial activism has elevated many DPSPs to rights, it can also blur institutional boundaries. 
	- Conversely, some DPSPs remain under-enforced due to capacity gaps
- Conclusion
	- The Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) have often been dismissed as “pious declarations” owing to their non-justiciable character.
	- Though not enforceable in a court of law, they function as guiding principles that have actively shaped India’s legislative and executive trajectories, particularly in the realms of social justice, economic equality, and welfare provisioning




## Personal Analysis:

Justice ensures everyone has the right to climb.
Equality ensures the rungs aren’t broken for some while golden for others.
Welfare ensures there’s a safety net if someone falls off.
