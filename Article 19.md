## Questions:

1. Discuss Section 66A of IT Act, with reference to its alleged violation of Article 19 of the Constitution.
2. What do you understand by the concept “freedom of speech and expression”? Does it cover hate speech also? Why do the films in India stand on a slightly different plane from other forms of expression? Discuss.

# Article 19

- Introduction
	- The freedom of speech and expression is a cornerstone of India's democracy, enshrined as a fundamental right under **Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution**
	- However, this freedom is not absolute. 
	- **Article 19(2) allows the state to impose reasonable restrictions** in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality
	- These restrictions are based on Harm Principle by J.S. Mill
- With regard to the freedom of speech and expression in India, there has been mainly the following challenges
	- Sedition Cases (Section 124A of IPC)
		- Under Section 124A, individuals responsible for contempt against the government established by law can be punishable with maximum punishment of life imprisonment
		- Kedarnath Singh v/s State of Bihar (1962)
			- Kedarnath Principle
				- Only speech that incites violence or has the tendency to create public disorder or threaten the security of the state can be punished as sedition
		- Shreya Singhal v/s UoI case 2015
			- The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which criminalized offensive online speech
			- The Court found the language of Section 66A to be open-ended and undefined, covering even innocent speech and having a chilling effect on free speech, thus exceeding the permissible restrictions under Article 19(2)
			- Mere discussion or even advocacy of a particular cause, howsoever unpopular, is at the heart of Article 19(1)(a). 
			- Only when the discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement, restrictions under Article 19(2) can be invoked.
		- After Kedarnath Singh case and Shreya Singhal case, the definition of sedition has been limited. 
		- Bal Gangadhar Tilak differentiates between 'Deshdroh' and 'Rajdroh', while former should be punishable under the law, latter is very much the part of citizen's right.
		- Section 124A IPC --> Section 152 BNS
			- Against "Acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India"
		- A state must balance **free expression** with **sovereign security**
	- Contempt of court
		- Types
			- **Civil contempt:** Disobedience of court orders.
			- Criminal contempt: Anything that scandalises or tends to lower the authority of the court, prejudices judicial proceedings, or obstructs justice
		- Landmark Judgments
			- E.M.S. Namboodiripad case (1970): 
				- Criticism of judiciary must be fair, rational; sweeping attacks amount to contempt.
			- Arundhati Roy Case (2002): 
				- Court held that free speech doesn’t grant license to scandalize judiciary.
			- **Prashant Bhushan Case (2020):** 
				- The Supreme Court said – it’s fine to criticize judges if you do it with reason and facts. 
				- But if you paint the whole judiciary as corrupt or biased without proof, you cross the line because it shakes people’s faith in justice itself.
		- Ambedkar after Champakam Dorairajan case (1951)
			- "As a citizen of India, he is bound to obey the orders but not to respect them"
	- Defamation
		- Under Article 19(2), defamation is a reasonable restriction on Fundamental Right to speech and expression
		- Case Laws
			- Rajagopal v/s State of Tamil Nadu (1994)
				- Government officials cannot raise defamation charges for the criticism of their official functions. 
				- Defamation stands only if actual malice is demonstrated
- Right to Information (RTI)
	- The right to information is founded on the principle that in a democracy all information held by government inherently belongs to the citizens. 
	- The Supreme Court has recognized the right to information as integral to Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution
	- The RTI movement was spearheaded by the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in Rajasthan. 
		- This movement transformed the architecture of democratic accountability by demonstrating how access to state information could empower the poor to challenge corruption, demand wages, and monitor welfare schemes
	- The Right to Information Act, 2005, institutionalized transparency as a democratic right
	- Institutional Framework
		- The RTI Act established a decentralized structure of Public Information Officers (PIOs) and Information Commissions at both central and state levels to enforce compliance
		- Online RTI portals have also been introduced as a digitization initiative
	- Challenges to Implementation
		- Exemptions under 'personal information'
			- A lack of a clear and consistent definition of 'personal information' enables authorities to invoke privacy under [[Article 21]] as a justification for withholding data—effectively turning the **right to information** into a **right to deny information**.
		- Structural and Institutional Deficits
			- Proactive disclosure, mandated by Section 4, is often lacking.
			- Inadequate Infrastructure and Human Resources
			- Both Central and State Information Commissions (CICs and SICs) suffer from long vacancies, poor funding, and limited staff, resulting in massive backlogs
		- Political Interference and Dilution of Mandate
			- The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, made the tenure, salaries, and conditions of service for CICs and SICs subject to executive discretion, eroding their independence
			- Many government departments perceive RTI as a nuisance rather than a democratic obligation
			- Over 100 RTI activists have been killed, and many assaulted for exposing corruption
			- Supreme Court's 2013 decision declaring political parties as "public authorities" under RTI has not been enforced.
	- Reforms for the RTI Ecosystem
		- Fill vacancies in Information Commissions
		- Launch widespread awareness campaigns, particularly in rural areas
		- Implement the Whistle Blowers Protection Act and mandate disclosures from political parties
