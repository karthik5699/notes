## Questions:

1. Mixing zones of Cold and Warm Ocean Currents (Grand Banks) and cold water upwelling zones (Peru coast) are the most productive fishing grounds on earth. Why?


# Pacific Ocean Currents

![[Pasted image 20250719150506.png]]

- Equatorial Pacific Ocean Currents
	- Under the influence of prevailing trade winds (tropical easterlies), the north equatorial current and the south equatorial current start from the eastern pacific (west coast of Central America) and traverses a distance of 14,500 km moving from east to west
- Counter equatorial current
	- This raises the level of western pacific (near Indonesia and Australia) ocean by few centimeters. 
	- And this creates a counter-equatorial current which flows between the north equatorial current and the south equatorial current in west-east direction.
- Kuroshio current
	- ![[Pasted image 20250717170940.png]]
	- The north equatorial current turns northward off the Philippines to form the Kuroshio current. 
	- Most of it lies in the sub-tropical high pressure belt and its northern part is under the influence of westerlies
- Oyashio Current and Okhotsk current
	- There are two more cold currents in the northern Pacific, Oyashio flows across the east coast of Kamchatka Peninsula to merge with the warmer waters of Kuroshio, and the Okhotsk current flows past Shaklain Islands to merge with the Oyashio current off Hokkaido
- North-Pacific current
	- From the south-east coast of Japan, under the influence of prevailing westerlies, the **Kuroshio current** turns eastwards and moves as the North-Pacific current, reaches the west coast of North America, and bifurcates into two
- Alaska and Californian current
	- The northern branch flows anti-clockwise along the coast of British Columbia and Alaska and is known as the Alaska current. The water of this current is relatively warm as compared to the surrounding waters in this zone.
	- The southern branch of the current moves as a cold current along the west coast of USA and is known as the Californian current. The Californian current joins the north equatorial current to complete the circuit.
- East Australian current
	- Following the pattern in the northern hemisphere, the south equatorial current flows from east to west and turns southwards as the East Australian current. It then meets the South pacific current near Tasmania which flows from west to east.
- Peru current or Humboldt Current
	- Reaching the south-western coast of South America, it turns northward as the Peru current. It is a cold current, which finally feeds the south equatorial current, thus completing the great circuit.
	- And the zone where Peru Cold current meets the warm equatorial ocean waters is an important fishing zone

- Phytoplankton and Fishing
	- ![[Pasted image 20250719153342.png]]
	- Phytoplankton are the primary producers in the marine food chain and hence they are called the ‘grass of the sea’.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Why are cold and warm current mixing zones the good fishing grounds? Why are tropical waters highly unproductive?</mark>
		- ![[Pasted image 20250719153652.png]]
		- Algae and other plants are able to photosynthesize to produce organic material from inorganic nutrients.
		- And the organic material forms the building block for all animals higher up in the food chain
		- However, there is a fundamental problem phytoplankton in the open ocean have to face. They need both sunlight and nutrients (such as nitrate and phosphate) to be able to photosynthesize.
		- Sunlight is only available in the uppermost layers.
		- During photosynthesis, the nutrients are quickly used up by phytoplankton so they are not available for long periods in the upper layers under normal circumstances
		- This is indeed the case in tropical waters, and as a result they are very unproductive
		- To escape this problem the seawater needs to be mixed regularly to bring the nutrient rich deep waters up to the sunlight zone where the phytoplankton can grow.
		- This is one of the reasons why cold and warm currents convergence zones (mixing happens – the collision of currents causes mixing) and upwelling zones are very productive
		- Furthermore, in surroundings where atmospheric temperatures are often colder than oceanic temperatures, the top layers of the ocean are cooled by the atmosphere
		- This increases the density of the surface waters and causes them to sink and therefore causes mixing
		- Both of these factors play a role in Icelandic waters, resulting in the very productive ocean environment around Iceland
