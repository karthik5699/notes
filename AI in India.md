## Questions:



# AI in India

- India aims to be a global leader in AI governance.
- However, this goal is weakened by the absence of a comprehensive national AI strategy
- IndiaAI Mission under MeitY is an executional mechanism, not a substitute for a national strategy

Key Risks in the Absence of Strategic Direction
- Without an indigenous AI strategy, India faces the risk of strategic dependencies on foreign technologies
- Lack of democratic data collection and curation frameworks may undermine public trust
- IMF estimates 26% of India's workforce exposed to AI.
- Despite this, there is no structured planning for re-skilling, social protection, or transition pathways

Energy and Sustainability Concerns
- AI is energy-intensive; data centre electricity use may double by 2030 (IEA).
- Groundwater levels are rapidly declining in Bengaluru and Hyderabad--both emerging AI and data centre hubs. 
- Yet policy discussions on AI in India have scarcely addressed the energy implications of scaling AI

Impact of AI
- AI will reshape work, education, and skill valuation.
- Leaving this to markets or technocrats risks inequality and exclusion
- Use of AI in healthcare, policing, welfare raises risks of bias and discrimination

Path Forward: Recommendations
- Publish a Cabinet-approved national AI strategy
- Establish a Standing Committee on AI & Emerging Technologies to oversee risks and policies
- Commission a national study to assess sector-wise and demographic impact of AI-driven job losses
