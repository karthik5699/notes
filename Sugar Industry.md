# Sugar Industry

- Introduction
	- Sugar is country’s second largest agro-based industry, next to cotton. 
	- India emerged world’s largest producer and consumer of sugar as well as the world’s 2nd largest exporter of sugar after Brazil.
- Sugarcane Cultivation: Key Requirements
	- Temperature: 28-32°C.
	- Rainfall: 75-120 cm annually.
	- Humidity: 70-85% during growth; 55-75% during ripening.
	- Soil: Well-drained, fertile soils.
	- Irrigation: Adequate and timely irrigation
- Geographical Distribution:
	- Largest sugar producing countries: 
		- India > Brazil > Thailand > China > United States of America
	- India
		- ![[Pasted image 20250915144958.png]]
		- In India Uttar Pradesh is the largest sugarcane producer.
		- Followed by Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
- Factors Influencing Location:
	- Close to Sugarcane Fields: 
		- Sugarcane, the primary raw material for sugar production, is highly perishable and cannot be stored post-maturity
	- Transportation costs: 
		- Mills are located near sugarcane fields to minimize costs.
	- Mills achieve energy self-sufficiency by using bagasse as fuel.
- Key Challenges:
	- Low yield: 
		- India's average yield is significantly lower than global leaders
	- Short crushing season: 
		- 4-7 months, leading to under-utilization of capacity
	- High production costs: 
		- Due to inefficient technology and high sugarcane prices.
	- High Water Footprint: 
		- Producing 1 kg of sugar requires ~1,500–2,000 litres of water.
		- This leads to [[Ground Water]] depletion, especially in Maharashtra and Karnataka
	- FRP vs. SAP pricing conflicts
		- Set by the Central Government, Fair and Remunerative Price is the minimum price that sugar mills must pay to sugarcane farmers
		- Set by individual state governments, State Advised Price is often higher than the FRP to provide additional benefits to local farmers
		- Sugar mills face financial stress due to the obligation to pay higher SAP, affecting their profitability and operations
- Recent Developments and Government Initiatives:
	- Ethanol Blending Program: 
		- 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. 
		- Sugarcane-based derivatives are expected to account for >50% of ethanol requirement.
	- Sugar Development Fund: 
		- Provides loans for modernization and expansion of sugar factories.
- Way Forward:
	- Implement Rangarajan Committee recommendations
		- Revenue sharing model (70:30 for farmers and mills).
		- Removal of minimum distance criterion between mills.
	- Promote crop diversification in water-stressed regions.
	- Invest in R&D for developing high-yielding, drought-resistant varieties.
