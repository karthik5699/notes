## Questions:



# The Preamble

- Introduction
	- The Preamble to the Indian Constitution is a foundational charter that encapsulates the vision, ethos, and aspirations of the Indian Republic. 
	- Described as the key to the Constitution by B.R. Ambedkar, it functions as a microcosm of the entire constitutional edifice
- **Ingredients of the Preamble** 
	- The Preamble reveals four key components
		- Source of authority of the Constitution: The people of India
		- Nature of Indian State: Declares India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, and republican polity
		- Objectives of the Constitution: Specifies justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity as the goals
		- Date of adoption of the Constitution: November 26, 1949
- Key words and their meaning
	- **Sovereign**
		- India is an independent state free to conduct its internal and external affairs
		- The phrase "We, the people of India" embeds the notion of popular sovereignty, placing constituent power directly in the hands of the people
		- Constitution as a 'social contract' between people and rulers
	- **Socialist**
		- The term 'Socialist' was **inserted into the Preamble by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976** 
		- It aims to achieve social and economic justice and establish a "socialistic pattern of society"
		- Even in the post-1991 era of economic liberalization, the term retains significance, with courts interpreting **Article 21 (Right to Life)** to include socio-economic rights like healthcare, housing, education, and livelihood, thus upholding the socialist mandate
	- **Secular**
		- Secularism was an implicit constitutional value grounded in the original Preamble's emphasis on equality, liberty, and fraternity
		- Formally added alongside 'Socialist' by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment in 1976
		- Indian secularism is distinct from the Western model of strict Church-State separation
		- Secular state in India follows principled distance model.
	- **Democratic Republic**
		- **Democracy** is conceived substantively, aiming to empower citizens politically, socially, and economically, beyond mere procedural formalities like periodic elections and universal adult franchise
		- Republic indicates that India has an elected head (the President), rather than a hereditary monarch
	- Justice
		- The Preamble pledges to secure social, economic, and political justice
	- **Liberty**
		- Signifies the absence of restraints and the provision of opportunities for individual development. 
		- It includes liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship
	- Equality: 
		- Means the absence of special privileges and the provision of adequate opportunities for all, without discrimination
	- Fraternity: 
		- Assures the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation
- Preamble as Part of the Constitution
	- Initially, in the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Berubari Union case (1960)</mark>, the Supreme Court opined that the Preamble, despite acting as the guiding light of the Constitution, was not a part of the Constitution
	- However, in the landmark <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)</mark>, the Supreme Court rejected its earlier opinion and held that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution and forms its basic structure ––> *Constitution must be interpreted in the grand and noble vision enshrined in Preamble*
	- This view was reaffirmed in the S.R. Bommai case (1995), where the Supreme Court again held that the Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution
- Conclusion
	- Thus, the Preamble stands as an important part of the Constitution, which in the words of an eminent jurist is 'identity card of the Constitution'.
