## Questions:

1. The recent cyclone on east coast of India was called ‘Phailin’. How are the tropical cyclones named across the world? Elaborate. 

# Storm Surge & Cyclones

- Storm Surge
	- ![[Pasted image 20250711150050.png]]
	- Storm Surge is an abnormal rise of sea level as the cyclone crosses the coast
	- Sea water inundates the coastal strip causing loss of life, large scale destruction to property & crop
	- Increased salinity in the soil over affected area makes the land unfit for agricultural use for two or three seasons.
- What is storm tide?
	- The storm tide is the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide.
- Why do ‘tropical cyclones’ winds rotate counter-clockwise (clockwise) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere?
	- As the earth’s rotation sets up an apparent force (called the Coriolis force) that pulls the winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere)
	- So, when a low pressure starts to form over north of the equator, the surface winds will flow inward trying to fill in the low and will be deflected to the right and a counter-clockwise rotation will be initiated. 
	- The opposite (a deflection to the left and a clockwise rotation) will occur south of the equator.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Why there are fewer cyclones over the Arabian Sea as compared to the Bay of Bengal?</mark>
	- ![[Pasted image 20250711151034.png]]
	- Cyclones that form over the Bay of Bengal are either those developing insitu over southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Andaman Sea or remnants of typhoons over Northwest Pacific and move across south China sea to Indian Seas.
	- As the frequency of typhoons over Northwest Pacific is quite high, the Bay of Bengal also gets its increased quota.
	- The cyclones over the Arabian Sea either originate insitu over southeast Arabian Sea (which includes Lakshadweep area also) or remnants of cyclones from the Bay of Bengal that move across south peninsula. 
	- As the majority of Cyclones over the Bay of Bengal weaken over land after landfall, the frequency of migration into Arabian Sea is low
	- In addition to all the above <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the Arabian Sea is relatively colder (monsoon winds) than Bay of Bengal</mark> and hence inhibits the formation and intensification of the system
- Why there are very few Tropical Cyclones during southwest monsoon season?
	- The southwest monsoon is characterized by the presence of strong westerly winds in the lower troposphere (below 5 km) and very strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere (above 9 km). 
	- This results **in large vertical wind shear**. Strong vertical wind shear inhibits cyclone development.
	- Active monsoon circulation makes the atmosphere becomes too turbulent and unstable for organized cyclones to form
- Naming of Cyclones
	- WMO (World meteorological organization) divided the world Oceans into Basins and assigned the responsibility of naming the Cyclones to the respective regional bodies
	- Each regional body has its own rules in naming cyclones. In most regions pre-determined alphabetic lists of alternating male and female names are used.
	- How are cyclones named in Northern Indian Ocean Region
		- The names of cyclones in Indian Seas are not allocated in alphabetical order, but are arranged by the name of the country which contributed the name.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711152512.png]]
		- The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which issues cyclone advisories to eight countries, maintains a list of cyclone names contributed by each member nation
		- Every time a cyclone occurs, a name is picked in the order of the names that are already submitted.
- Low Pressure, Depression and Cyclone
	- How are low pressure system classified in India?
		- The pressure criteria is used, when the system is over land and wind criteria is used, when the system is over the sea.
		- The system is called as low if there is one closed isobar in the interval of 2 hPa.
		- It is called depression, if there are two closed isobars, a deep depression, if there are three closed isobars and cyclonic storm if there are four or more closed isobars
- States Vulnerable to Cyclones
	- ![[Pasted image 20250711153129.png]]
- 4-stage warning system for Tropical Cyclones
	- 1999, IMD introduced a 4-Stage warning system to issue cyclone warnings to the disaster managers. They are as follows:
		- Pre-Cyclone Watch
			- Issued when a depression forms over the Bay of Bengal irrespective of its distance from the coast and is likely to affect Indian coast in future.
			- Issued at least 72 hours in advance of the commencement of adverse weather
		- Cyclone Alert
			- Issued at least 48 hours before the commencement of the bad weather when the cyclone is located beyond 500 Km from the coast
		- Cyclone Warning
			- Issued at least 24 hours before the commencement of the bad weather when the cyclone is located within 500 Km from the coast.
			- Information about time/place of landfall are indicated in the bulletin
		- Post landfall outlook
			- It is issued 12 hours before the cyclone landfall, when the cyclone is located within 200 Km from the coast.
