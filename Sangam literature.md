# Sangam literature

Introduction: Sangam literature refers to the body of classical Tamil texts composed between 300 BCE and 300 CE during the assemblies (Sangams) of poets under royal patronage, primarily of Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas. It represents one of the earliest known secular literatures in India.

Key features:
- very popular amongst the masses
- written in old Tamil, marked by poetic brevity and symbolic expression
- 2 major schools of Sangam literature
	- aham/agam - deals with abstract ideas like love, emotions, etc
	- puram - deals with human experiences like social life, ethics, valour, customs
- Major works
	- Ettuttokoi (eight anthologies) and Pattupattu (10 songs)
	- Tolkappiyam - a textbook on Tamil grammar
	- Pathinenkilkanakku - post-Sangam didactic works
- Secular nature - unlike Vedic texts, Sangam literature is largely non-religious

Socio-Political insights:
- texts are non-linear and poetic, offering no systematic political history
- political events are narrated with mythical embellishment and exaggerated heroism
- Sangam poets have mentioned four varnas: Arashar (King/nobility), Brahmanas (priests), Viashiyar (traders), Velala (farmer)
- unlike North India, South India did not have a stringent Varna system
- women were allowed to choose their partners. Love marriages were also common. The life of widow was miserable and Sati was practised.

Economic insights:
- there were 5 economic zones known as tinai, each of them supporting a different economic activity
- kings received income from trade, tributes and plunder but a regular taxation system was not present
- main occupational activities were Agriculture, Gathering, Fishing, Hunting and pastoralism
- Women were actively involved in spinning, weaving, basket making, planting, flower selling etc.


Sangam literature is a **vital historical source** offering a **multi-dimensional** understanding of early Tamilakamâ€™s **culture, polity, and society**. Despite its **limitations in reconstructing political history**, Sangam literature remains an **indispensable source** for understanding the **socio-economic fabric** of early South India.



## Personal Analysis:

Tamilakam means the land of the Tamils. It includes the territories of Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas. It represents one of the earliest linguistically defined regions in Indian history.
