# Mathura School of Art

The Mathura School of Art was a prominent sculptural tradition that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to 12th century CE, centered in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh). It represents an indigenous Indian artistic style known for its religious eclecticism, covering Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical themes, and is considered one of the three main schools of ancient Indian art alongside Gandhara and Amaravati.

- Emerged under the patronage of Kushanas (1st–3rd century CE), and later developed during the Gupta period (4th–6th century CE)
- Unlike Gandhara, which was Greco-Roman in influence, Mathura art was homegrown and indigenous in style
- Found predominantly in Mathura, Sarnath and Kosambi
- Material: Red sandstone
- Themes may vary from Buddhist, Jainism, Brahmanical to sometimes secular
- First anthropomorphic images of Buddha appeared here
- Emphasis on yaksha and yakshi figures with sensuous, voluptuous forms
- Female figures shown in tribhanga posture
- It is famous for the headless erect statue of Kanishka
