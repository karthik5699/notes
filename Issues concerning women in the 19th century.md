# Issues concerning women in the 19th century

The women's question in pre-independence India emerged prominently as an integral part of the 19th-century socio-religious reform movements. This period saw a "new vision" and "reawakening" among enlightened Indians, who recognized that India's stagnation and subjugation under foreign rule were linked to weaknesses within its social structure and culture. The improvement of the status of women in the society was considered to be vital for broader social progress. 

The position of women in 19th-century Indian society was "depressing" and marked by numerous outdated and exploitative social customs and traditions:

1. Low Status and Lack of Individuality: 
	- Women were generally accorded a low status, considered to be inferior to men, with no identity of their own
2. Female Infanticide: 
	- Attempts to kill female infants at birth were not unusual
3. Child Marriage
	- Those who escaped this initial brutality were subjected to the violence of marriage at a tender age
4. Dowry
	- The evil of dowry was also especially widespread, particularly in Bengal and Rajputana
5. Polygamy
	- Polygamy was prevalent among both Hindus and Muslims
6. Sati and the Plight of Widows
	- The most distressing was the practice of sati, where widows, especially among higher castes, were expected to commit self-immolation upon their husbands' death. If they did not, they were condemned to a life of "misery, neglect and humiliation"
7. Purdah System
	- This system significantly suppressed women's freedom and hindered the progress of women
8. Denial of Education
	- Education was generally denied to women, making their presence in elementary schools rare


#### Major Debates and Approaches to Reform
1. Religious Sanction vs. Rationality
	- Reformers like Raja Rammohan Roy (anti-sati) and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar (widow remarriage) cited ancient texts to prove that true religion did not support these practices, appealing to "humanity, reason and compassion"
	- In contrast, some reformers, like Gopal Hari Deshmukh, adopted a purely rational and secular outlook, arguing against practices based on their detrimental effects on society
		- Gopal Hari Deshmukh notably stated, "If religion does not sanction social reform, then change religion"
2. Modernization vs. Westernization
	- While reformers aimed for modernisation rather than westernisation, integrating modern ideas into Indian cultural streams, there was a fear among orthodox sections that women adopting "Western ways" would corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values
3. Scope & Pace of Reform
	- The initial reform movements often had a "narrow social base, being limited to the upper and middle classes and upper castes"
4. Impact on Traditional Social Order
	- Conservatives feared that women's education and public participation would turn the world upside down, and threaten the basis of the entire social order
	- Even reformers who supported women's education often saw women "primarily as mothers and wives," intending for them to "remain within the enclosed spaces of the household"
	- Mahatma Gandhi, while instrumental in bringing women into the freedom struggle, held views on gender roles that would be considered "patriarchal and traditional by present standards," emphasizing distinct vocations for men (breadwinner) and women (mistress of the house & caretaker of infants)


#### Pioneering Efforts and Legislative Measures
- Abolition of Sati: 
	- Through Raja Rammohan Roy's relentless campaigning, the practice of sati was declared illegal and punishable in 1829
- Widow Remarriage: 
	- Vishnu Shastri Pandit founded the Widow Remarriage Association in the 1850s
	- Karsondas Mulji started the 'Satya Prakash' in Gujarati in 1852 to advocate widow remarriage. Similar efforts were made by Professor D.K. Karve in western India and by Veerasalingam Pantulu in Madras.
	- Jyotiba Phule was a pioneer of widow remarriage movement in Maharashtra and also opened a home for widows in 1854.
	- Inspired by Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's efforts, the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856 legalized widow remarriage and children born from such unions
- Child Marriage Restraint:
	- The relentless efforts of B.M. Malabari were rewarded by the enactment of the Age of Consent Act (1891) which forbade the marriage of girls below the age of 12.
	- The Sarda Act (1930) further pushed up the marriage age to 18 and 14 for boys and girls, respectively
- Education for Women:
	- Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar is considered one of the pioneers of women’s education
	- Charles Wood’s Despatch on Education (1854) laid great stress on the need for female education
	- By the 1880s, Indian women began entering universities, training as doctors and teachers


Conclusion: The social reform movements, the freedom struggle, movements led by enlightened women themselves and, later, free India’s Constitution have done much for the emancipation of women.
