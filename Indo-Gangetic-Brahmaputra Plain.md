# Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain

![[Pasted image 20250726161340.png]]
- Introduction
	- The formation of Indo-Gangetic plain is closely related to the formation of Himalayas
- Formation of Indo – Gangetic – Brahmaputra trough
	- ![[Pasted image 20250726163625.png]]
	- The rivers which were previously flowing into Tethys sea (Before Indian Plate collided with Eurasian Plate – continental drift, plate tectonics) deposited huge amount of sediments in the Tethys Geosyncline.
	- Himalayas are formed out of these sediments which were uplifted, folded and compressed due to northern movement of Indian Plate.
	- Northern movement of Indian Plate also created a trough to the south of Himalayas.
- Depositional Activity
	- As the mountains were rising, old rivers changed their path again and again
	- Each time, they became stronger and younger (this is called rejuvenation)
	- These rivers cut into the land deeply at first (headward and vertical erosion), and later spread sideways (lateral erosion)
	- This cutting and carrying brought lots of debris (pebbles, sand, clay, etc.) down from the mountains into the hollow plain (trough)
- New rivers and more alluvium
	- The raising of Himalayas and subsequent formation of glaciers gave rise to many new rivers. 
	- These rivers along with glacial erosion {Glacial Landforms}, supplied more alluvium which intensified the filling of the depression.
	- Over time, so much material filled up the hollow that the Tethys Sea disappeared completely.
	- What was left was a flat and wide plain filled with layers of sand, clay, gravel, and other river deposits — this is the Indo-Gangetic plain we see today.
- Features of Indo – Gangetic – Brahmaputra Plain
	- Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plain is the largest alluvial tract of the world
	- The northern boundary is well marked by the Shiwaliks and the southern boundary is a wavy irregular line along the northern edge of the Peninsular India.
	- The western boarder is marked by Sulaiman and Kirthar ranges. On the eastern side, the plains are bordered by Purvanchal hills
	- The width of the plain varies from region to region. It is widest in the west where it stretches for about 500 km. Its width decreases in the east.
	- The thickness of the alluvium deposits also vary from place to place
	- Its average elevation is about 200 m above mean sea level, highest elevation being 291 m above mean sea level near Ambala (in Haryana) (This elevation forms the drainage divide or watershed between Indus system and Ganga system).
- Geomorphological features of Indo – Gangetic – Brahmaputra Plain
	![[Pasted image 20250726164551.png]]
	- The Bhabar
		- It is a narrow, porous, northern most stretch of Indo-Gangetic plain
		- It is about 8-16 km wide running in east-west direction along the foothills (alluvial fans) of the Shiwaliks
		- They show a remarkable continuity from the Indus to the Tista.
		- Rivers descending from the Himalayas deposit their load along the foothills in the form of **alluvial fans**.
			- ![[Pasted image 20250726164825.png]]
		- These alluvial fans have merged together to build up the bhabar belt.
		- The **porosity** of bhabar is the most unique feature
		- The porosity is due to deposition of huge number of pebbles and rock debris across the alluvial fans
		- The streams disappear once they reach the bhabar region because of this porosity.
		- Therefore, the area is marked by dry river courses except in the rainy season
		- The area is not suitable for agriculture and only big trees with large roots thrive in this belt.
	- The Terai
		- ![[Pasted image 20250726165031.png]]
		- Terai is an ill-drained, damp (marshy) and thickly forested narrow tract to the south of Bhabar running parallel to it.
		- The Terai is about 15-30 km wide
		- The underground streams of the Bhabar belt re-emerge in this belt.
		- This thickly forested region provides shelter to a variety of wild life. 
			- Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam lie in terai region
		- The Terai is more marked in the eastern part than in the west because the eastern parts receive comparatively higher amount of rainfall.
		- Most of the Terai land, especially in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, has been turned into agricultural land which gives good crops of sugarcane, rice and wheat
	- The Bhangar
		- The Bhangar is the older alluvium along the river beds forming terraces higher than the flood plain
		- The terraces are often impregnated with calcareous concretions known as ‘KANKAR’. 
		- ‘The Barind plains’ in the deltaic region of Bengal and the ‘bhur formations’ in the middle Ganga and Yamuna doab are regional variations of Bhangar.
		- Bhangar contains fossils of animals like rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephants, etc.
	- The Khadar
		- The Khadar is composed of newer alluvium and forms the flood plains along the river banks.
		- A new layer of alluvium is deposited by river flood almost every year
		- This makes them the most fertile soils of Ganges
	- Reh or Kollar
		- Reh or Kollar comprises saline efflorescences of drier areas in Haryana.
		- Reh areas have spread in recent times with increase in irrigation (capillary action brings salts to the surface)
