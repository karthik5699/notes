- Warm Temperate Eastern Margin Climate
	- Different variants of Warm Temperate Eastern Margin Climate include
		- Temperate monsoon Climate or China Type Climate
		- Gulf Type Climate
		- Natal Type Climate
- Climate
	- Characterized by a **warm moist summer** and a **cool, dry winter** (one exception: winters are also moist in Natal Type)
- Temperature
	- The mean monthly temperature varies between 4° C and 25° C and is strongly modified by maritime influence
	- Occasionally, the penetration of cold air ([[Polar Vortex]]) from the continental interiors may bring down the temperature to freezing point
- Precipitation
	- Rainfall is more than moderate, anything from 60 cm to 150 cm
	- Areas which experience this climate are very densely populated
	- There is the fairly uniform distribution of rainfall throughout the year
	- In summer, the regions are under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the subtropical anticyclonic cells
	- Local storms, e.g. **typhoons (tropical cyclones)**, and **hurricanes**, also occur
- Economic Development
	- ![[Pasted image 20250716162559.png]]
	- Farming in monsoon China
		- A third of the world’s rice is grown in China, though the huge population leaves very little for export
	- Agriculture in the Gulf states
		- Lack of population pressure and the urge to export gave rise to corn, cotton and tobacco
		- Corn
			- ![[Pasted image 20250716163124.png]]
			- The humid air, the sunny summer and the heavy showers suit the crop well
			- It is grown right from the Gulf coast to the Mid-west south of the Great Lakes, with the greatest concentration in the Corn Belt of Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana and Ohio
			- The region accounts for more than half the world’s production of corn, but only 3 per cent of the world’s export.
			- This is because most of the corn is used for fattening animals, mostly cattle and pigs
		- Cotton
			- Of the cash crops grown in the Gulf states, none is comparable with cotton.
			- The Gulf type of climate is undoubtedly the **best for cotton growing**
			- The commercial cultivation of cotton is now concentrated only in the most favourable areas which are the Mississippi flood plains and Atlantic coastlands.
			- The most dreaded enemy of the Cotton Belt is the boll-weevil. The pest multiplies rapidly. The pest is responsible for the westward migration of the Cotton Belt.
				- ![[Pasted image 20250716163052.png]]
		- Tobacco
			- Native crop of America.
			- No less than half the tobacco that enters international trade comes from these states.
	- Crop in Southern Hemisphere
		- In the coastlands of Natal, cane sugar is the dominant crop, followed by cotton and tobacco in the interior
