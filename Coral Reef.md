# Coral Reef

![[Pasted image 20250721153800.png]]
- Introduction
	- Coral reefs are fragile marine ecosystems built by polyps in symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, requiring specific temperature, salinity, and sunlight conditions to thrive.
	- They are often called the "rainforests of the sea"
	- Coral reefs over a period of time transform or evolve into coral islands (Lakshadweep).
- Coral Reef Relief Features
	- ![[Pasted image 20250721154708.png]]
	- Fringing reef, barrier reef and atoll (coral islands are formed on atolls) are the most important relief features.
	- Fringing Reefs
		- ![[Pasted image 20250721155244.png]]
		- Grow directly from the shoreline, forming a narrow belt (1–2 km wide) with a shallow lagoon between reef and coast.
		- Seaward side slopes steeply into deep sea; coral growth stops abruptly due to sudden depth increase
		- Most common type of reef; lagoons here are relatively narrow and shallow compared to other reef types.
	- Barrier Reefs
		- ![[Pasted image 20250721155423.png]]
		- Extensive linear reefs running parallel to the shore, separated by a lagoon.
		- Less common than fringing reefs or atolls; found in tropical Atlantic and Pacific
		- World’s largest example: the 1200-mile Great Barrier Reef, a vast complex of many reefs rather than a single formation.
	- Atolls
		- ![[Pasted image 20250721160025.png]]
		- Circular oceanic reefs enclosing a deep central lagoon (80–150 m), connected to the sea by channels.
		- Formed around submerged islands or volcanic cones suitable for coral growth.
		- Most abundant in the Pacific; examples include Funafuti (Ellice Islands), Fiji and groups in French Polynesia, Micronesia, Caroline, Marshall, and Cook Islands.

		- The Indian Ocean also contains numerous atoll formations. Examples are found in the Maldives and Chagos island groups, the Seychelles, and in the Cocos Island group
- Development Of Major Coral Reef
	- ![[Pasted image 20250721162104.png]]
	- The basic coral reef classification scheme described above was first proposed by Charles Darwin, and is still widely used today.
	- Darwin theorised that fringing reefs began to grow near the shorelines of new islands as ecological conditions became ideal for hard coral growth
	- Then, as the island began to gradually subside into the sea, the coral was able to keep pace in terms of growth and remained in place at the sea surface, but farther from shore; it is now a barrier reef.
	- Eventually, the island disappeared below the sea surface, leaving only the ring of coral encircling the central lagoon; an atoll had formed.
- Formation Of Lakshadweep Islands
	- Lakshadweep Islands formed by coral growth on volcanic peaks of the Chagos-Lakshadweep Ridge
	- Corals started growing around these volcanic islands
	- Over time, the volcanic islands sank, likely due to sea level rise or subsidence
	- The corals kept growing upward, forming ring-shaped reefs called atolls
	- These coral reefs became the Lakshadweep islands we see today

- Ideal Conditions for Coral Growth
	- Stable climatic conditions: 
		- Corals are highly susceptible to quick changes. 
		- They grow in regions where climate is significantly stable for a long period of time.
	- Perpetually warm waters: 
		- Corals thrive in tropical waters where diurnal and annual temperature ranges are very narrow
		- Explain why coral reefs are absent on west coast of tropical continents? Because of Cold Ocean Currents – corals like warm waters and hate cold waters
	- Shallow water: 
		- Coral require fairly good amount of sunlight to survive. 
		- The ideal depths for coral growth are 45 m to 55 m below sea surface, where there is abundant sunlight available.
	- Abundant Plankton: 
		- Adequate supply of oxygen and microscopic marine food, called plankton (phytoplankton), is essential for growth. 
		- As the plankton is more abundant on the seaward side, corals grow rapidly on the seaward side.
	- Little or no pollution: 
		- Corals are highly fragile and are vulnerable to climate change and pollution and even a minute increase in marine pollution can be catastrophic
- Distribution of Coral Reefs
	- ![[Pasted image 20250721164025.png]]
	- Some of the largest coral reefs are the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)
	- India
		- ![[Pasted image 20250915220737.png]]
		- Gulf of Kutch (Gujarat), Gulf of Mannar (Tamil Nadu), Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep Islands
- Symbiotic Relationship Between Corals And Zooxanthellae
	- Zooxanthellae live inside coral polyp tissues, performing photosynthesis to supply corals with energy-rich carbon compounds and aid calcification.
	- In return, corals provide a safe habitat and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis
	- Coral tissues are naturally transparent; their vibrant reef colors come from the zooxanthellae
- Coral Bleaching or Coral Reef Bleaching
	- ![[Pasted image 20250721164919.png]]
	- Coral reefs face natural (storms, floods, temperature extremes, ENSO, predators, diseases) and anthropogenic pressures (overfishing, overexploitation, sedimentation, nutrient overload).
	- Bleaching is a stress response where zooxanthellae density and/or their pigments decline, causing corals to lose color.
	- Recovery is possible if stress subsides within weeks to months; prolonged stress leads to coral death.
- Ecological Causes of Coral Bleaching
	- Temperature
		- Coral species live within a relatively narrow temperature margin, and anomalously low and high sea temperatures can induce coral bleaching.
		- Bleaching events occur during sudden temperature drops accompanying intense upwelling episodes (El-Nino), seasonal cold-air outbreaks
		- This is an instance of coral reefs’ susceptibility to increased water temperatures combined with OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.
			- Ocean acidification occurs when the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide
		- While the rising temperatures have increased the frequency and intensity of bleaching, acidification has reduced corals calcifying ability
	- Fresh Water Dilution
		- Rapid dilution of reef waters from storm-generated precipitation and runoff has been demonstrated to cause coral reef bleaching
	- Inorganic Nutrients
		- Rather than causing coral reef bleaching, an increase in ambient elemental nutrient concentrations (e.g. ammonia and nitrate) actually increases zooxanthellae densities 2-3 times
		- Although eutrophication is not directly involved in zooxanthellae loss, it could cause secondary adverse effects such as lowering of coral resistance and greater susceptibility to diseases
- Consequences of global coral bleaching
	- Coral reef ecosystems are less than 0.1% of the ocean area but provide food and shelter to 25% of all marine species
	- They support fish stocks on which some 500 million people are dependent globally
