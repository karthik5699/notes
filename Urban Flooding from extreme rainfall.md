## Questions:

1. Incidence of extreme rainfall events and flash floods in recent times has led to devastating consequences for major cities of India. Analyse.
2. What are the environmental implications of the reclamation of water bodies into urban land use? explain with examples?

# Urban Flooding from extreme rainfall

- Introduction
	- Extreme rainfall events are identified by IMD as precipitation exceeding 65mm per day. And flash floods are characterized as floods that begins within 6 hours of a heavy rainfall. 
- Why extreme rainfall events are increasing
	- **Climate change** → Warmer atmosphere holds ~7% more moisture per °C rise, leading to heavier downpours.
	- **Indian monsoon variability** → More _short, intense bursts_ instead of long, steady rains, as shown in IMD data since 1950s.
	- **Urban Heat Island effect** → Cities are hotter, locally intensifying convection and rainfall
- Urban vulnerabilities turning rainfall into disasters
	- Cities are mostly **impermeable surfaces** (concrete, asphalt) → less infiltration, more runoff.
	- Depletion of natural drainage systems through construction activities
		- Mumbai’s mangroves lost to construction
	- Encroachment on floodplains
- Consequences
	- **Human cost**: Deaths from electrocution, drowning, building collapse
	- **Economic**: Crores lost in business shutdowns, property damage, and transport disruption
	- **Public health**: Outbreaks of leptospirosis, cholera, dengue
	- **Social**: Displacement, disruption of schooling and livelihoods
	- **Ecological**: Contamination of rivers and wetlands with sewage and industrial waste
- Way Forward
	- Climate-resilient urban planning
	- Restore and protect wetlands, lakes, and floodplains as natural buffers
	- Promote permeable pavements, rooftop rainwater harvesting, and green roofs.
	- Build _real-time flood forecasting_ and early warning systems
