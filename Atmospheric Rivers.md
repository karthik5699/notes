## Questions:

1. What are 'atmospheric riversâ€™? How do they influence global weather patterns and impact human settlements?

# Atmospheric Rivers

- An atmospheric river is a long, relatively narrow band of water vapour that forms over an ocean and flows through the sky, transporting moisture from the tropics to northern latitudes.
- They are formed by winds **associated with cyclones** and move under the influence of other weather patterns.
- While many atmospheric river events are weak, powerful ones can carry extraordinary amounts of moisture.

When an Atmospheric River Reaches the Land
- ![[Pasted image 20250811174544.png]]
- As the moisture-laden air moves over mountain ranges, the water vapour rises and cools
- This cooling results in **heavy precipitation** that falls as rain or snow.
- Help form snowpack in mountain regions
- **Unlike traditional cold winter storms**, atmospheric rivers tend to be **warm**.
- Can push warm tropical air into polar areas, causing short-term temperature spikes and speeding up ice sheet melt (e.g., abnormal ice melt in Greenland).

Uses of Atmospheric Rivers
- Replenish Water: Essential for refilling water sources in arid regions
- Wildfire Mitigation: Provide rainfall to help extinguish wildfires.

Atmospheric rivers are projected to increase in intensity with climate change due to the atmosphere's enhanced moisture-holding capacity at higher temperatures
