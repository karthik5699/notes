# Polar Vortex

![[Pasted image 20250715145033.png]]
- Introduction
	- A polar vortex is a large pocket of very cold air, typically the coldest air in the Northern Hemisphere, which sits over the polar region during the winter season
	- Polar Vortex is
		- Cold
		- Upper tropospheric: sometime extending till the lower levels of stratosphere
		- Circumpolar
		- Low pressure
		- Large cyclonic parcel of air
	- Polar vortex is closely associated with jet streams (Rossby waves)
	- It is formed mainly in winter and gets weaker in summer.
	- It surrounds polar highs and lie within the polar front (boundary separating the temperate and polar air masses).
- Polar Vortex Cold Wave
	- The polar vortex will remain in its place when the Westerlies along with the polar jet are strong (Strong polar vortex means there is huge temperature contrast between the temperate and polar regions)
	- When the polar vortex is weak, it intrudes into the midlatitude regions by buckling the general wind flow pattern. This leads to significant cold outbreaks in the midlatitude regions.
	- The vortex is capable of delivering subzero temperatures to the United States and Canada where is occurs the most.
	- How it slips
		- The Polar jet traverses somewhere over 65 degree N and S latitudes. When the temperature contrast between polar and temperate regions is maximum, the jet is very strong and the meandering is negligible.
		- But when the temperature contrast is low (doesn’t mean it’s summer), the jet starts to meander (Rossby waves).
		- Meandering jet creates alternating low and high pressure cells. High pressure cells are created below the ridges and the low pressure cells below the troughs
		- ![[Pasted image 20250715145937.png]]
		- With severe meandering, the high pressure cells push over to north and displace the polar cyclone from its normal position i.e. the cyclone moves away from the pole and slips into the temperate regions where there is an intense low pressure
		- ![[Pasted image 20250715151124.png]]
		- With the strengthening of the jet, the high pressure cells become weak and retreat to their normal latitudinal positions. With the retreat of the high pressure cells, the polar cyclone moves back to its normal position – poles.
- Ozone Hole (Ozone Depletion at South Pole)
	- Polar vortex and ozone depletion are two distinct but related phenomena
	- There is a steady decline of about 4% in the total volume of ozone in Earth’s stratosphere
	- Much larger decrease in stratospheric ozone is observed around Earth’s polar regions
	- Depletion of ozone is due to increase in halocarbons in the atmosphere
	- Halocarbon == a compound in which the hydrogen of a hydrocarbon is replaced by halogens like chlorine, bromine, iodine etc.
	- Halogen atoms like chlorine destroy ozone
		- Photodissociation (under the influence of sunlight) of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) like halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (CFCs, HCFCs, carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane, freons, halons) creates free chlorine atoms that destroy ozone
		- ![[Pasted image 20250715151738.png]]
		- But how does a chlorine atom reach to such high levels of atmosphere?
			- Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs)
				- They are nacreous clouds
					- Nacreous clouds, sometimes called mother-of-pearl clouds, are rare clouds.
					- ![[Pasted image 20250715151852.png]]
					- They are mostly visible within two hours after sunset or before dawn
					- They are seen mostly during winter at high latitudes like Scandinavia, Iceland, Alaska and Northern Canada. Sometimes, however, they occur as far south as England.
				- Polar Stratospheric Clouds or nacreous clouds contain water, nitric acid and/or sulphuric acid
				- They are formed mainly during the event of polar vertex in winter; more intense at south pole
				- The Cl-catalyzed ozone depletion is dramatically enhanced in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs)
				- ![[Pasted image 20250715152233.png]]
				- Polar Stratospheric Clouds convert “reservoir” compounds into reactive free radicals
				- So Polar Stratospheric Clouds accelerate ozone depletion
- Ozone Depleting Substances
	- Ozone depleting substances are man-made gases that destroy ozone once the gases reach the ozone layer.
	- Ozone depleting substances include:
		- Chlorofluorocarbons
			- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were widely used as refrigerants until the 1980s.
			- They are also considered greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
		- Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
			- Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been used as a substitute for CFCs, and cause less damage
				- Since HCFCs are used as interim substitute to replace CFC, these are allowed up to 1st January 2040.
	- Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985)
		- It established global monitoring and reporting on ozone depletion
		- It also created a framework for the development of protocols for taking more binding action
	- Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
		- The Montreal Protocol under the Vienna Convention (the protocol) was agreed in 1987
		- It facilitates global cooperation in reversing the rapid decline in atmospheric concentrations of ozone.
		- Under the protocol countries agreed to phase out the production and consumption of certain chemicals that deplete ozone
		- The Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol are the first and only global environmental treaties to achieve universal ratification, with 197 parties.
		- As a result of the international agreement, the ozone hole in Antarctica is slowly recovering.
	- Kigali amendment to Montreal Protocol 2016
		- The parties are expected to reduce the manufacture and use of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by roughly 80-85% from their respective baselines, till 2045
		- This phase down is expected to arrest the global average temperature rise up to 0.5 °C by 2100.
		- It is a legally binding agreement between the signatory parties with non-compliance measures
