## Questions:



# Judiciary

- Introduction
	- The principal role of the judiciary is to protect rule of law and ensure supremacy of law. 
	- It safeguards rights of individuals, settles disputes in accordance with law and ensures that democracy does not give way to dictatorship. 
	- The motto of Supreme Court of India is "Yato Dharmasthato Jaya" (Where there is Dharma there is victory)
- Independence of Judiciary
	- Means that
		- the legislature and executive must not interfere with the functioning of the judiciary
		- judges must be able to perform their functions without fear or favour
	- Constitutional provisions
		- The legislature is not involved in the process of appointment of judges
		- Judges have a fixed tenure
		- Constitution prescribes a very difficult procedure for the removal of judges
		- The salaries and allowances of the judges are not subjected to the approval of legislature
		- Judiciary has the power to penalise those who are found guilty of contempt of court
		- Parliament cannot discuss the conduct of the judges except when the proceeding to remove a judge is being carried out.
- Role and Constitutional Basis in India
	- In India, the judiciary is a central pillar of constitutional governance and operates within a system of separation of powers
	- Guardian of the Constitution: 
		- The Supreme Court is the final interpreter of the Constitution and the guarantor of fundamental rights
	- Constitutional Supremacy: 
		- India is a constitutional democracy where the Constitution is supreme, not Parliament. 
		- The judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, is empowered to enforce constitutional rights and review legislative and executive actions
	- Judicial Review: 
		- Under Articles 32 and 226, the Supreme Court and High Courts can strike down laws and executive actions that violate the Constitution
- Judicial appointments
	- The system of judicial appointments in India, particularly to the higher judiciary (SC & HC), is a subject of significant political debate. 
	- It has evolved considerably, raising fundamental questions about judicial independence, democratic accountability, and transparency
	- Historical Evolution and the Collegium System
		- Initially, the Indian Constitution vested judicial appointments in the executive, with the President making appointments in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and other judges. 
		- However, this system underwent a transformative shift through a series of landmark judicial decisions, commonly known as the "Judges Cases"
			- First Judges Case (1981)
				- Held that the President (executive) had primacy in judicial appointments, and the Chief Justice’s opinion was not binding.
			- Second Judges Case (1993) 
				- Overturned the first, giving primacy to the judiciary 
				- Evolved the collegium system led by the Chief Justice of India (CJI + 2 senior most judges)
			- Third Judges Case (1998)  
				- Clarified collegium as a five-member body (CJI + 4 senior-most judges), making collective consultation binding.
			- Fourth Judges Case (NJAC, 2015) 
				- Struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission as unconstitutional 
				- Reaffirming judicial independence through the collegium
		- This evolution was driven by the perceived need to shield the judiciary from executive interference
	- Core Criticisms of the Collegium System
		- Lack of Transparency: 
			- The system operates without a codified procedure, formal application process, or public scrutiny. 
			- This opacity leads to allegations of nepotism, judicial favoritism, and the exclusion of meritorious candidates, particularly from marginalized communities
		- Absence of Democratic Accountability: 
			- The complete exclusion of the executive and legislature from the appointment process raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.
			- Critics argue it leads to a self-selecting oligarchy that is unaccountable to the people in a democratic polity
		- Under-representation and Diversity Deficit: 
			- The Collegium has been criticized for failing to ensure adequate representation of women, Dalits, Adivasis, Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and minority communities within the higher judiciary
		- Procedural Delays and Executive-Judiciary Deadlocks: 
			- Appointments are frequently delayed due to a lack of consensus within the Collegium or between the judiciary and the executive. 
			- This has led to a high number of judicial vacancies, exacerbating the problem of access to justice and overburdening the courts
	- The fundamental dilemma is how to protect the judiciary from political capture while ensuring it remains accountable and is not perceived as a self-selecting oligarchy
	- Proposed Reforms and the Way Forward
		- Codifying the Collegium procedure through legislation to introduce objectivity, criteria-based evaluation, and transparency
		- Establishing an independent Judicial Appointments Commission with institutional safeguards to ensure independence while incorporating other stakeholders
		- Mandating diversity quotas or guidelines for social representation to address the deficit in representation
- Judicial Activism
	- Judicial Activism refers to a proactive interpretation of laws and constitutional provisions, often to protect rights, fill legal vacuums, or address systemic injustices. 
	- It involves courts going beyond literal interpretation to ensure the "spirit" of the Constitution is upheld
	- It has forced executive accountability.
	- Theoretical Foundations and Legitimacy
		- The Supreme Court has invoked constitutional morality to interpret laws in line with evolving social values and to uphold constitutional values even against majoritarian pressures
		- The judiciary is imagined not merely as a dispute-resolver but as the moral custodian of the social contract, particularly for the vulnerable and voiceless
		- Transformative Constitutionalism views the Constitution as a living document aimed at dismantling structural inequalities and bringing about social change
	- Evolution of Judicial Activism in India
		- Era of Judicial Restraint (1950s–1970s): 
			- Initially, the judiciary adopted a deferential approach to the legislature and executive, largely adhering to a formalist interpretation of laws
			- E.g. Shankari Prasad case (1951) & Sajjan Singh case (1965)
		- Confrontation and Assertion (1973–1980s): 
			- The Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case was a turning point, introducing the Basic Structure Doctrine which limited Parliament's amending power 
			- This period also saw the Emergency (1975–77), which highlighted judicial vulnerability (e.g., ADM Jabalpur case). 
			- Post-Emergency, the Court reasserted its independence and adopted a more proactive stance, notably through the emergence of Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
		- Institutional Expansion (1990s–2010s): 
			- Judicial activism intensified, with courts increasingly venturing into governance and policy domains. 
				- Education (Unnikrishnan case), Environment (MC Mehta cases) , Corruption (Vineet Narain case), and Electoral reforms (PUCL case), Vishaka Guidelines (1997) 
			- This phase saw the judiciary redefining its institutional autonomy, particularly with the establishment of the Collegium system
		- Contemporary Contestations (2010s–Present): 
			- The judiciary continues to wield significant power, with landmark judgments such as Navtej Singh Johar (2018) (decriminalizing homosexuality), Sabarimala temple entry case, and Justice K. S. Puttaswamy case (2017) (Right to Privacy). 
			- However, this era has also seen intensified criticisms of judicial overreach
				- Striking down of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in 2015
				- The Supreme Court's cancellation of telecom licenses in the 2G Spectrum case (2012)
	- Key Mechanisms
		- Judicial activism has been primarily channeled through:
			- [[Public Interest Litigations]] (PIL): 
				- This mechanism transformed access to justice by relaxing locus standi, allowing public-spirited individuals or organizations to approach courts on behalf of disadvantaged groups and address systemic injustices
				- PIL became the most important vehicle of Judicial Activism
			- Expansive Interpretation of Fundamental Rights: 
				- The judiciary has creatively expanded the scope of Article 21 to include rights to livelihood (Olga Tellis case, 1985), education (Unni Krishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1993), a clean environment (Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar, 1991; M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, 1987), health, shelter, and privacy (K.S. Puttaswamy case 2017)
	- Implications for Constitutional Democracy and Separation of Powers
		- Erosion of Separation of Powers: 
			- While judicial activism is celebrated for rights protection, critics warn that excessive activism risks sliding into judicial overreach, undermining separation of powers (Article 50)
		- Democratic Legitimacy and Accountability: 
			- Judges are unelected and not directly accountable to the public. 
			- When courts enter into the domain of public policy it raises questions about governance without representation and democratic legitimacy
			- This is a central critique of Dworkin's theory of rights as trumps, where empowering judges can risk undermining democratic legitimacy
		- Institutional Competence: 
			- Courts may lack the technical expertise or administrative machinery for complex policy decisions
- Conclusion
	- While the judiciary has been crucial in protecting fundamental rights and safeguarding democracy, it also faces ongoing debates about its accountability, transparency, and potential for overreach, necessitating a need for balance and self-restraint.
