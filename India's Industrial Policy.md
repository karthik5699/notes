# India's Industrial Policy

India’s industrial policy has evolved from a state-controlled model to a liberalised, market-oriented framework. It reflects the country's shifting developmental priorities—from self-reliance to global integration.

- Early Approach: State-Led Planned Development
	- In the immediate aftermath of independence, India faced challenges of widespread poverty, illiteracy, and a damaged agricultural and industrial sector due to colonial rule.
	- The leadership agreed that development should encompass both economic growth and social and economic justice, and that the government must play a key role, rather than leaving it solely to private actors
	- India opted for a mixed economy model, incorporating features from both liberal-capitalist and socialist models. 
	- This model allowed for the coexistence of public and private sectors, with the private sector encouraged to grow within the national plan's objectives. 
	- The state's primary responsibility was defined as poverty alleviation and socio-economic redistribution
	- Key features of this phase:
		- Emphasis on Heavy Industries: 
			- The Second Five Year Plan (1956-1961), drafted under P.C. Mahalanobis, significantly stressed heavy industries
		- Import Substitution: 
			- The government imposed substantial tariffs on imports to protect domestic industries, which fostered growth in both public and private sectors. 
			- This policy aimed to reduce India's dependence on advanced countries for basic goods and capital equipment
		- Public Sector Dominance: 
			- Industries such as electricity, railways, steel, machinery, and communication were primarily developed in the public sector
	- Criticism:
		- Critics argued that the planning strategy displayed an "urban bias" and that emphasis on industry caused agriculture and rural India to suffer
		- Planners were criticized for not providing enough space and stimulus for the private sector to grow. 
		- The public sector's expansion, coupled with systems of licenses and permits, created hurdles for private capital and discouraged quality improvement due to limited competition from imports
		- Despite impressive growth in some sectors, poverty and inequalities persisted on a large scale, and benefits of economic growth did not reach all sections of society
	- From 1967 onwards, under Indira Gandhi, the state's role in the economy was further strengthened, including the nationalization of fourteen private banks and new restrictions on private industry
		- The government announced many pro-poor programmes. These changes were accompanied by an ideological tilt towards socialist policies.
		- However, by the 1980s, public opinion began to lose faith in these institutions due to inefficiency and corruption, leading policymakers to reduce the state's role in the economy
	- New Economic Policy (1991 Reforms)
		- The origin of the economic crisis can be traced from the inefficient management of the Indian economy in the 1980's. 
		- In the late 1980's government expenditure began to exceed its revenue by such large margins that it became unsustainable. 
		- Inflation was soaring, imports grew in excess to the export to such a level that foreign exchange reserves declined to a level that it was not adequate to finance imports for more than two weeks.
		- To manage this crisis, India approached the World Bank and IMF, receiving a $7 billion loan, but with conditions to open up the economy by reducing government's role and removing trade restrictions
		- This led to the announcement of the New Economic Policy (NEP), centered on Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG Policy)
		- Liberalization:
			- Industrial licensing was largely abolished for almost all product categories, except for a few like alcohol, cigarettes, and hazardous chemicals
			- The only industries now reserved for the public sector are defence equipments, atomic energy generation and railway transport.
			- Import licensing was abolished for most goods (with exceptions for hazardous industries) to promote efficiency, competitiveness, and foreign investment and technology
			- Major aim of financial sector reforms was to reduce the role of RBI from regulator to facilitator of financial sector.
			- This led to the establishment of private sector banks and the entry of foreign banks
			- Since 1991, there has been a continuous reduction in the taxes on individual incomes. The rate of corporation tax was reduced; simplification of procedures to pay the income tax was also initiated.
			- Initially the rupee was devalued against foreign currencies. This led to the increase in the inflow of foreign exchange.
		- Privatization:
			- The government began to shed ownership and management of state-owned enterprises through disinvestment
			- The goal was to improve financial discipline and facilitate modernization.
			- Efforts were also made to grant PSUs more autonomy in managerial decisions to enhance efficiency
		- Globalization:
			- As an outcome of liberalization and privatization, globalization implied greater interdependence and integration with the world.
			- While providing access to global markets and high technology, it has also been noted that market-driven globalization has widened economic disparities among nations and people
