## Questions:

1. The political and administrative reorganization of states and territories has been a continuous ongoing process since the mid-nineteenth century. Discuss with examples.

# Reorganisation of States

The reorganization of states in India was a crucial and complex process that shaped the internal boundaries of the country after independence, moving away from the administrative divisions inherited from British colonial rule. This process aimed to reflect India's linguistic and cultural plurality without jeopardizing national unity.

- Background and Initial Challenges
	- During British rule, state boundaries were determined by administrative convenience or coincided with territories annexed by the British or ruled by princely powers
	- The Indian National Congress (INC) had long rejected these artificial divisions. In its Nagpur Session in 1920, the INC adopted the linguistic principle for its own organizational structure, creating provincial Congress Committees based on linguistic zones. 
	- Mahatma Gandhi and Lokmanya Tilak were among those who supported this linguistic reorganization of the Congress
	- After the bitter partition of India based on religion, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was apprehensive about further dividing the country on linguistic lines, fearing it might threaten national unity and divert attention from economic and social challenges
- Early Efforts and Commissions
	- Linguistic Provinces Commission (Dhar Commission): 
		- In 1948, the Constituent Assembly appointed the Justice S.K. Dhar-headed Linguistic Provinces Commission to assess the desirability of linguistic provinces, particularly for areas like Andhra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Maharashtra. 
		- The commission advised against it, citing threats to national unity and administrative inconvenience
	- JVP Committee: 
		- To address the rising vocal demands for linguistic states, the Congress formed the JVP Committee (Nehru, Sardar Patel, and Pattabhi Sitaramayya) in December 1948. 
		- Its report also recommended against the immediate creation of new provinces, stating the time was not suitable.
- The Catalyst: The Andhra Movement
	- Despite the commissions' reports, demands for separate states based on linguistic identity gained momentum, with movements like Ayikya Kerala, Samyukta Maharashtra, and Vishalandhra
	- Potti Sriramulu's Fast: 
		- The movement for a separate Telugu-speaking state (Vishalandhra movement) became particularly intense in the old Madras province
		- Potti Sriramulu, a Congress leader and Gandhian, undertook a fast unto death in 1952, demanding a separate Andhra.
		- In response to the escalating unrest, GoI was forced to create the first linguistic state of Andhra.
- The States Reorganisation Commission (SRC)
	- The formation of Andhra spurred similar demands across the country. 
	- Consequently, in 1953, Nehru appointed the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), comprising Justice Fazl Ali and two others, to objectively examine the entire question of state reorganization
	- The SRC submitted its report in 1955, largely accepting the linguistic principle for redrawing state boundaries. Based on its recommendations, the States Reorganisation Act was passed in November 1956, which provided for the creation of 14 states and six centrally administered territories
- New States & Union Territories created after 1956
	- Maharashtra & Gujarat
		- In 1960, Bombay was divided into two separate states--Maharashtra for Marathi-speaking people and Gujarat for Gujarati-speaking people.
	- Goa, Daman & Diu
		- India acquired them from the Portuguese by means of a police action in 1961
		- They were constituted as a union territory, later in 1987 Goa was conferred statehood.
	- Puducherry
		- Comprising the former French establishments of Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam were handed over to India in 1954
	- North-East Reorganization
		- The state of Nagaland was formed in 1963
		- Meghalaya, Manipur, and Tripura became separate states in 1972
		- Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh became separate states in 1987
- Recent Reorganizations (2000-2014): Demands for new states persisted based on distinct regional culture, lack of development, or administrative inconvenience
	- Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand (2000): 
		- Were created out of territories of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar respectively
	- Telangana (2014):
		- The new state of Telangana came into existence as the 29th state of the Indian Union.
	- Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh (2019):
		- The erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir was bifurcated into two separate union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh
			- Kargil and Leh district from J&K have gone to UT of Ladakh


The story of reorganisation has not come to an end. There are many regions in the country where there are movements demanding separate and smaller states. These include Vidarbha in Maharashtra and the northern region of West Bengal.

Linguistic reorganisation of states did not lead to disintegration of the country as many had feared earlier. On the contrary it strengthened national unity. More importantly, it showed that Indian democracy meant not just elections, but a deeper commitment to accepting diversity and multiple ways of life.
