## Questions:



# Tsunami üåä

- A tsunami is a series of very long-wavelength waves in large water bodies like seas or large lakes caused by a major disturbance above or below the water surface or due to the displacement of a large volume of water
- Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, underwater explosions, meteorite impacts, etc. have the potential to generate a tsunami.
- The Pacific among the oceans has witnessed the greatest number of tsunamis

- Primary Causes
	- Megathrust Earthquakes:
		- The most common cause (over 70%) is undersea earthquakes, particularly at subduction zones where one tectonic plate slides beneath another. 
		- When the seafloor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water, it initiates a tsunami.
		- The tsunami on December 26, 2004, was caused after an earthquake displaced the seabed off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.
	- **Volcanic Eruptions:** 
		- Violent underwater volcanic eruptions can also displace a large volume of water and trigger tsunamis. 
- Distribution
	- Tsunamis can occur in any major body of water but are most frequent in the **Pacific Ocean** due to the high seismic activity along the "Ring of Fire." 
	- This region has numerous subduction zones, making it highly susceptible to the types of earthquakes that generate tsunamis. 
	- Countries like Japan, Indonesia, Chile, and the west coast of the United States are particularly vulnerable.
- 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
	- Tsunami or the Harbour wave struck havoc in the Indian Ocean on the 26th of December 2004
	- The wave was the result of an earthquake that had its epicentre near the western boundary of Sumatra
	- The magnitude of the earthquake was 9.0 on the Richter scale
	- Plate Tectonics
		- **Indian plate** went under the **Burma plate**, there was a sudden movement of the sea floor, causing the earthquake
		- The ocean floor was displaced by about 10 ‚Äì 20m and tilted in a downward direction
		- A huge mass of ocean water flowed to fill in the gap that was being created by the displacement.
		- This marked the withdrawal of the water mass from the coastlines of the landmasses in the south and Southeast Asia
		- After thrusting of the Indian plate below the Burma plate, the water mass rushed back towards the coastline as a tsunami.
	- Tsunami waves
		- Tsunami travelled at a speed of about 800 km. per hour, comparable to speed of commercial aircraft and completely washed away some of the islands in the Indian ocean
		- In India, the worst affected were the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Pondicherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
- In the **2011 T≈çhoku tsunami in Japan**, entire towns were washed away,
- Tsunami Warning Systems
	- While the earthquake cannot be predicted in advance, it is possible to give a three-hour notice of a potential tsunami.
	- Such early warning systems are in place across the Pacific Ocean. Post-2004, they were installed in the Indian Ocean as well
	- Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC): Established by Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) in Hyderabad after the 2004 tsunami.
