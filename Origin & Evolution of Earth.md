## Questions:



# Origin & Evolution of Earth

#### Early theories of Earth's origin:

- Nebular Hypothesis 
	- Proposed by: Immanuel Kant and later modified by Laplace
	- Idea: A giant cloud of gas and dust (called nebula) slowly began to spin.
	- Due to spinning, it flattened like a disc.
	- The center formed the Sun, and the smaller clumps around it became planets — including Earth.

#### Modern Theories and Origin of the Universe

- Big Bang Theory: 
	- This is the most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe, also known as the expanding universe hypothesis
	- In 1920, Edwin Hubble provided evidence that the universe is expanding, with galaxies moving further apart over time
	- The Big Bang Theory outlines three main stages in the universe's development:
		- Initially, all matter forming the universe existed as a "tiny ball" (singular atom) with unimaginably small volume, infinite temperature, and infinite density
		- The "tiny ball" exploded violently in the Big Bang, leading to a massive expansion. This event is generally accepted to have occurred 13.7 billion years ago and continues to the present day. 
		- Within 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to 4,500 K, giving rise to atomic matter, and the universe became transparent
	- Evidence supporting the Big Bang Theory includes 
		- the red-shift of light from other galaxies (indicating they are moving away), 
		- the existence of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, which is considered the remnant energy from the Big Bang
		- presence of Gravitational waves
			- helps in measuring the expansion rate of the universe
		- the abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium
- Formation of Stars and Planets
	- Star Formation
		- The distribution of matter and energy was not even in the early universe. 
		- These initial density differences gave rise to differences in gravitational forces and it caused the matter to get drawn together. These formed the bases for development of galaxies.
		- A galaxy contains a large number of stars.
		- A galaxy starts to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called nebula. Eventually, growing nebula develops localised clumps of gas. These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies, giving rise to formation of stars.
		- Star formation is believed to have occurred some 5-6 billion years ago
	- Planet Formation
		- Planets form from localized lumps of gas within a nebula, which develop a core. 
		- A disk-shaped cloud of gas and dust forms around this core. 
		- These gas clouds then experience condensation of matter into small, rounded objects called planetesimals. In the final stage, these numerous small planetesimals accrete to form fewer, larger bodies, which become planets
	- Our Solar System: 
		- Our solar system consists of the sun (a star), 8 planets, 63 moons, millions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets, and vast quantities of dust grains and gases. 
		- The nebula that formed our solar system began to collapse and form a core about 5-5.6 billion years ago, and the planets were formed around 4.6 billion years ago
		- The sun is at the center, and all bodies revolve around it, held by its gravitational pull. The sun accounts for almost 99.9% of the solar system's matter and is its energy source
			- Composition: 98% of the sun is hydrogen & helium
			- Sunspots are temporary dark patches on the Sun's surface (photosphere) that are cooler than the surrounding areas.
				- They appear dark because they are about 1500–2000°C cooler than the surrounding surface
				- Caused by magnetic disturbances
				- The number of sunspots rises and falls in an 11-year cycle, called the solar cycle
			- Solar Wind
				- The solar wind is made of plasma (ionised atoms), a stream of energised, charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, flowing outward from the Sun at very high speeds and temperature
				- Effects of Solar Winds
					- Solar wind hits Earth’s magnetic field → charged particles excite atmospheric gases → creates Northern (Aurora Borealis) and Southern Lights (Aurora Australis).
					- Sudden surges in solar wind can disrupt power grids, GPS, satellites.
			- Solar Flares
				- A solar flare is a sudden, intense burst of energy and radiation released from the Sun’s surface — like a giant explosion in space.
				- It happens in the Sun’s atmosphere 
		- Inner/Terrestrial Planets: 
			- Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are inner planets, located between the sun and the asteroid belt. 
			- They are called "Terrestrial" because they are made of rock and metals and have relatively high densities. 
			- Their formation close to the sun meant it was too warm for gases to condense into solid particles. Intense solar winds blew off much gas and dust from these smaller planets, whose lower gravity couldn't hold escaping gases
		- Outer/Jovian Planets: 
			- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are outer planets. 
			- They are also called "Jovian" (jupiter-like) planets. 
			- They are much larger than terrestrial planets and have thick atmospheres, mainly of helium and hydrogen, as they formed at a greater distance from the sun where conditions allowed gases to condense and solar winds were less intense
	- Evolution of the Earth
		- Evolution of Lithosphere (Layered Structure):
			- The earth was mostly in a volatile state during its primordial stage. 
			- Due to gradual increase in density the temperature inside has increased. 
			- As a result the material inside started getting separated depending on their densities
			- This allowed heavier materials (like iron) to sink towards the centre of the earth and the lighter ones to move towards the surface. (Iron Catastrophe)
			- It is through the process of differentiation that the earth forming material got separated into different layers. (Planetary Differentiation)
			- Starting from the surface to the central parts, we have layers like the crust, mantle, outer core and inner core
		- Evolution of Atmosphere and Hydrosphere
			- There are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere. 
			- The first stage is marked by the loss of primordial atmosphere. 
				- Composed of hydrogen and helium, was stripped off by solar winds
			- In the second stage, the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolution of the atmosphere. 
				- During the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapour were released from the interior solid earth
				- This started the evolution of the present atmosphere
				- The early atmosphere largely contained water vapour, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen
				- The process through which the gases were outpoured from the interior is called degassing
			- Finally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.
				- Life was initially confined to the oceans. Oceans began accumulating oxygen through photosynthesis
				- Around 2,000 million years ago, after oceans were saturated, oxygen began to flood the atmosphere
	- Moon
		- The diameter of the moon is only one-quarter that of the earth
		- The moon is tidally locked to the earth, meaning that the moon revolves around the earth in about 27 days which is the same time it takes to complete one spin. As a result of tidal locking, only one side of the moon is visible to us on the earth.
		- It is now generally believed that the formation of the moon, as a satellite of the earth, is an outcome of a ‘giant impact’ or what is described as ‘the big splat’



## Personal Analysis:

The inner planets are rocky because it was too hot near the Sun for gas and ice to stay. Only rock and metal could survive, so the planets that formed — Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars — are made of rocky stuff.
