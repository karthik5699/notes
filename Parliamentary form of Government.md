## Questions:



# Parliamentary form of Government

- Introduction
	- A parliamentary form of government is a system where the executive is drawn from and accountable to the legislature, and continues in office only as long as it enjoys the confidence of the elected house
	- Centre of gravity of Indian political system. 
	- It is the highest sovereign authority in India as it represents 'general will' of the people.
- Key factors that led to this choice
	- Historical Familiarity and Precedent
		- Indians had considerable experience with representative government since the late nineteenth century, participating in local self-government and legislative bodies established by British acts like the Government of India Acts of 1909, 1919, and 1935
		- This enabled them to learn and appreciate the system
		- K.M. Munshi, a member of the Constituent Assembly, questioned why they should abandon a hundred-year-old tradition of parliamentary government in India
		- The 1935 Government of India Act, which provided the basis of government until the new Constitution, included a parliamentary system
	- Need for a Strong, Stable, and Effective Government
		- The Constituent Assembly believed a strong government was essential to bring about the social revolution India needed for survival
		- At the time of independence, India faced immense challenges, including widespread lawlessness, the aftermath of Partition, the integration of princely states, food shortages, refugee crises, and external security threats such as the Pakistan-inspired invasion of Kashmir in October 1947
		- The British system of cabinet government was seen as providing the strength and cohesive action required. 
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Dr. B.R. Ambedkar highlighted that the parliamentary system, unlike the American presidential system, allowed for daily assessment of responsibility, which was far more effective and necessary in a country like India, thereby prioritizing more responsibility to more stability</mark>
			- E.g. Farm Laws (2020): Government faced daily questioning in Parliament
	- Commitment to Democratic Principles
		- While seeking a strong executive, the Assembly was also wary of autocratic power, a sentiment shaped by colonial rule. 
		- The Parliamentary system offered a model that balanced executive strength with democratic accountability
- Rejection of Alternative Models
	- American Presidential System: 
		- There is a danger of personality cult in presidential executive
		- This model was rejected due to concerns that it could lead to perpetual cleavage, feud, or conflict between the legislature and the executive, which an infant democracy cannot afford
		- Prof. Ramesh Thakur, "Familiarity with Parliamentary Democracy breeds contempt for it and the unfamiliarity with the Presidential model generates romanticism"
- Since Independence, several key changes have marked Parliament's working:
	- Increased Representation: 
		- The 1990s saw a dramatic change in the composition of MPs in the Lok Sabha, with an increase in representation from Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
	- Shift to Coalition Politics: 
		- The decline of single-party governments, particularly the end of the Congress era, led to an increase in the number of parties in the House and the rise of coalition governments
	- Enhanced Role of the Speaker: 
		- In the era of coalition governments, the Speaker's role as a mediator between government and opposition and as an authority on parliamentary procedures has become more pronounced
	- Committee Structure: 
		- Historically weak due to large government majorities, the committee structure has been stimulated by the rise of coalition politics
- Challenges and Criticisms
	- Decline in Working Days and Disruptions: 
		- The Lok Sabha's average sitting days have declined from 121 days per year in the 1950s-1960s to 56 days between 2000 and 2024. 
		- A significant portion of scheduled time is lost to disruptions, violating the essence of Article 85
	- Marginalization of Parliament
		- Parliament can become marginalized, with executive orders replacing debate and consultation
		- Farm Laws Repeal Bill (2021) was passed in just eight minutes (three minutes in the Lok Sabha, five minutes in the Rajya Sabha)
			- In the US, Senator Ted Cruz was given the opportunity to speak for 21 hours and 19 minutes in the Senate House, against Obamacare in 2013.
		- The PMO and Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), often bypasses Parliament on critical foreign policy issues, leading to limited influence on decision-making
	- Delegated Legislation
		- The increasing complexity of governance has led to Parliament passing skeletal laws, delegating major powers to the executive
	- Anti-defection Law (Tenth Schedule): 
		- Enacted in 1985, this law mandates that an MP must adhere to their party's direction on every vote, or risk disqualification. 
		- Critics argue this curtails the freedom and independence of MPs
	-  Lack of Recorded Voting: 
		- On most motions, including bills, the Speaker takes a voice vote, meaning individual MP's voting records are not available. 
		- This weakens accountability to constituents, as citizens cannot easily track how their representatives vote on crucial issues
	- Speaker's Impartiality: 
		- Concerns exist regarding the Speaker's impartiality, particularly in decisions on disqualification petitions, certification of Money Bills (which bypass the Rajya Sabha's full scrutiny), and admission of no-confidence motions
	- Ordinance Promulgation: 
		- The President can promulgate ordinances on the advice of the Prime Minister, subject to parliamentary approval. 
		- This allows the executive to bypass Parliament and has been used by coalition governments to avoid debating legislation with allies as well as the opposition
	- Judicial Intervention and Overreach: 
		- There is a palpable sense that the authority of the Parliament is in decline. 
		- The judiciary has increasingly intervened in policy-making and even struck down legislation through judicial review, sometimes filling perceived gaps where Parliament has failed to act
- Suggestions for Better Performance of Parliament
	- Strengthening Intra-Party Democracy
		- There is a need to introduce intra-party democracy in the selection process of candidates to tackle the problem of dynasty, wealth and power
	- National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) (2000)
		- Minimum number of days of 100-120 days for Parliament
	- Repeal the Anti-Defection Law: 
		- To restore the MP's ability to exercise independent judgment and hold the executive accountable, the anti-defection law should be repealed entirely
	- Pre-legislative Consultation Policy 2014
		- Bills to be placed in public domain 30 days before they are to be introduced in parliament
	- Mandatory Recorded Voting: 
		- All votes in Parliament should be mandatorily recorded and reported.
	- Addressing Criminalization of Politics: 
		- Enacting laws to bar candidates with serious criminal charges from contesting elections, as proposed by various committees and commissions
- Enduring Significance
	- Despite the challenges, Parliament has generally flourished in India, providing a robust forum for debate and representation.
	- India's Constitution has lasted over 70 years, with regular elections and peaceful transfers of power, testifying to the general population's faith in the democratic system and Parliament's role in sustaining it.
