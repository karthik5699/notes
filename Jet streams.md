# Jet streams

Jet streams are relatively narrow bands of strong wind in the upper levels of the atmosphere.

Jet streams are 
- Circumpolar
	- ![[Pasted image 20250708143424.png]]
	- Jet streams are winds that circle around the earth with poles as their centers.
- Narrow, concentrated bands
	- The stream of air is very narrow (50 -150 km across)
- Meandering
	- ![[Pasted image 20250708143617.png]]
	- When the temperature contrast is maximum, jet stream flows in near straight path
	- But when temperature contrast reduces, the jet stream starts to follow a meandering path.
	- So meandering depends on temperature contrast (temperature gradient).
	- Rossby Waves
		- The meandering jet streams are called Rossby Waves.
		-  ![[Pasted image 20250708144423.png]]
		- In planetary atmospheres, they are due to the variation in the Coriolis effect (When temperature contrast is low, speed of jet stream is low, and Coriolis force is weak leading to meandering) with latitude.
		- Rossby waves are formed when polar air moves toward the Equator while tropical air is moving poleward.
			- Rossby waves help transfer heat from the tropics toward the poles and cold air toward the tropics in an attempt to return atmosphere to balance
		- The slow motion of these waves often results in fairly long, persistent weather patterns.
- Upper Tropospheric
	- Jet streams flow just below the Tropopause.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250708145102.png]]
	- Polar jet streams flow 6 – 9 km above the ground and Sub-tropical jet streams flows 10 – 16 km above the grounds
- High velocity
	- Pressure gradient increases with altitude and creates high velocity winds at higher altitudes.
	- The friction in the upper troposphere is quite low due to less denser air. Hence the Jet streams flow at great velocities.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250708145233.png]]
	- The jet streams have an average velocity of 120 kilometres per hour in winter and 50 km per hour in summer. These jet streams also have cores where the speed is much greater.
- Geostrophic streams
	- Direction of the jet stream is determined by pressure gradient force (temperature contrast creates pressure gradients) and Coriolis force.
	- The direction of jet stream is perpendicular to the pressure gradient force
- Are a part of upper level westerlies
	- Jet streams are produced due to winds flowing from tropics towards poles 
	- Anything moving from tropics towards poles deflects towards their right in the northern hemisphere and towards their left in the southern hemisphere due to Coriolis effect. 
	- So jet streams flow from west to east in both the hemispheres and hence they are called westerlies or upper level westerlies.


Permanent jet streams
- There are two permanent jet streams – **subtropical jets** at lower latitudes and **polar front jets** at mid-latitudes.
- ![[jetstream_crosssection.png]]
- Subtropical jet stream (STJ)
	- The sub-tropical jet stream is produced by the earth’s rotation (Coriolis force) and temperature contrast between tropical and sub – tropical regions.
	- At the equator, the rotation produces greatest velocity in the atmosphere
	- As a result, the rising air which spreads out northwards and southwards, moves faster than the latitudes over which it is blowing
	- It is deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere, and at about 30° latitude, it becomes concentrated as the subtropical jet streams.
	- During winter, the STJ is nearly continuous in both hemispheres.
	- STJ is closely connected to the Indian and African summer monsoons
- Polar front jet (PFJ)
	- The polar front jet is produced by a temperature difference and is closely related to the polar front
	- It has a more variable position than the sub-tropical jet. In summer, its position shifts towards the poles and in winter towards the equator
	- The jet is strong and continuous in winter.
	- It greatly influences climates of regions lying close to 60 degree latitude.
	- It determines the path and speed and intensity of temperate cyclones.


Influence of Jet Streams on Weather
- ![[Pasted image 20250708154336.png]]
- Jet streams help in maintenance of latitudinal heat balance by mass exchange of air.
- Jet streams also influence the path of temperate cyclones. They have an influence on distribution of precipitation by the temperate cyclones.
- Sub-tropical jet stream and some temporary jet streams together influence Indian Monsoon patterns

Jet Streams and Weather in Temperate Regions
- PFJ play a key role in determining the weather because they usually separate colder air and warmer air.
- Jet streams generally push air masses around, moving weather systems to new areas and even causing them to stall if they have moved too far away.
- PFJ play a major role in determining the path and intensity of frontal precipitation and frontal cyclones or temperate cyclones.
- Weak PFJ also results in slipping of polar vortex into temperate regions

- Explanation
	- Polar jet has distinct peaks (ridges) and troughs.
	- Ridges occur where the warm air (at high pressure) pushes against the cold air.
	- Troughs occur where cold air (at lower pressure) drops into warm air.
	- This condition occurs due to weak jet stream which is weak due to lesser temperature contrast between sub-tropics and temperate region.
	- These ridges and troughs give rise to jet streaks which are the main reason behind cyclonic and anticyclonic weather conditions at the surface.
	- The winds leaving the jet streak are rapidly diverging, creating a lower pressure at the upper level (Tropopause) in the atmosphere. The air below rapidly replaces the upper outflowing winds. This in turn creates the low pressure at the surface. This surface low pressure creates conditions where the surrounding surface winds rush inwards. The Coriolis effect creates the cyclonic rotation that is associated with depressions.
	- The winds entering the jet streak are rapidly converging, creating a high pressure at the upper level (Tropopause) in the atmosphere. This convergence at upper troposphere leads to divergence (high pressure) at the surface (anticyclonic condition).
	- The Coriolis effect creates the anticyclonic rotation that is associated with clear weather.

Jet Streams and Aviation
- Jet streams are used by aviators if they have to fly in the direction of the flow of the jet streams, and avoid them when flying in opposite direction.
- Jet streams can also cause a bumpy flight, because the jet stream is sometimes unpredictable and can cause sudden movement, even when the weather looks calm and clear.
- During volcanic eruptions plumes of volcanic ash have a tendency to get sucked into the same jet stream that airplanes use for travel.
