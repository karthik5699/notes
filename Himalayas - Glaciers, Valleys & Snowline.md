## Questions:

1. How will the meeting of Himalayan glaciers have a far-reaching impact on the water resources of India?
2. How does the cryosphere affect global climate?

# Himalayas - Glaciers, Valleys & Snowline

- Important Valleys in Himalayas
	- the valley of Kashmir and the Karewas 
		- Karewas
			- Karewas are lacustrine deposits (deposits in lake) in the Valley of Kashmir and in Bhadarwah Valley of the Jammu Division
			- These are the flat topped mounds that border the Kashmir Valley on all sides
			- They are characterized with fossils of mammals and at places by peat.
			- Formation
				- ![[Pasted image 20250725182459.png]]
				- During the Pleistocene Period (1 million years ago), the entire Valley of Kashmir was under water.
				- Subsequently, due to endogenetic forces, the Baramullah Gorge was created and the lake was drained through this gorge
				- The deposits left in the process are known as karewas
			- Economic Significance
				- ![[Pasted image 20250725182722.png]]
				- The karewas are mainly devoted to the cultivation of saffron, almond, walnut, apple and orchards
				- The karewas, devoted to saffron cultivation are fetching good income to the growers.
	- the Kangra and Kulu valley in Himachal Pradesh
	- the Dun valley (Doon valley, Dehradun valley); the Bhagirathi valley (near Gangotri) and the Mandakini valley (near Kedarnath) in Uttarakhand
	- the Kathmandu valley in Nepal
- Snow in Himalayas – Snowline
	- In Eastern Himalayas and Kumaon Himalayas the snowline is around 3,500 m above sea level whereas in western Himalayas snowline is about 2,500 m above sea level
	- Glaciers in Himalayas
		- There are about 15,000 glaciers in the Himalayas
		- The snow line (the lowest level of perpetual snow) varies in different parts of the Himalayas depending upon **latitude, amount of precipitation and local topography**.
		- Glaciers of the Karakoram Range
			- ![[Pasted image 20250726151858.png]]
			- Maximum development of glaciers occurs in the Karakoram range
			- Some of the largest glaciers outside the polar and sub-polar regions are found in this range
			- The **75 km long Siachen Glacier** in **Nubra valley** has the distinction of being the largest glacier outside the polar and the sub-polar regions
		- Glaciers of the Pir Panjal Range
			- The glaciers of the Pir Panjal Range are less numerous and smaller in size as compared to those of the Karakoram Range.
			- The longest Sonapani Glacier in the Chandra Valley of Lahul and Spiti region is only 15 km long
		- Glaciers of the Kumaon-Garhwal Region
			- In the Kumaon-Garhwal region of the Himalayas, the largest is the 30 km long Gangotri Glacier which is the source of the holy Ganga.
- Impact of the melting of Himalayan Glaciers
	- Most of north India’s great rivers—the Ganga, Yamuna, Indus, Brahmaputra—are either glacier-fed or glacier-assisted. 
	- Monsoon rains refill them in the wet season, but in the lean, dry months it’s glacial melt that sustains their flow
	- Rivers swell more in summer due to accelerated glacial melt → initially looks like more water availability, but also means increased risk of floods & Glacial Lake Outburst Floods
	- Once glaciers shrink beyond a threshold, their ability to release water declines.
	- Indo-Gangetic plains (India’s breadbasket) depend on glacier-fed irrigation. Reduced flows mean crop stress, food insecurity
	- Himalayan rivers are major energy sources. Unstable flows threaten production and energy security
	- **Urban supply**: Cities like Delhi depend on Yamuna water, which itself depends on Himalayan inputs
	- In conclusion, the melting of Himalayan glaciers is not merely an environmental concern but a foundational threat to India's water, food and energy security.

- Significance of the Himalayas
	- Influence on Indian Climate
		- They intercept the summer monsoons coming from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea causing precipitation in the entire Ganga Plains, North-Eastern Hills
		- They direct the monsoon winds towards north-western India 
		- They protect northern-plains from the cold continental air masses of central Asia
		- The Himalayas influence the path of Sub-tropical Jet stream flowing in the region. They split the jet stream and this split jet stream plays an important role in bring monsoons to India.
		- Had there been no Himalayas, the whole of India would have been a desert and its winters would have been very severe.
	- Defense
		- The Himalayas are a natural defence barrier.
	- Source of Rivers
		- Rivers that feed nearly half a billion population of India originate in Himalayas.
		- All the rivers are perennial supplying water year round
	- Fertile Soil
		- The swift flowing rivers from Himalayas bring enormous amount of silt (alluvium) which constantly enrich the Ganga and Brahmaputra plains.
	- Hydroelectricity
		- Due to its natural topography and swift flowing perennial rivers, the Himalayan region offers several natural sites with great hydroelectric power generation potential
	- Forest Wealth
		- The Himalayan host rich coniferous and evergreen forests. Lower levels have tropical evergreen forests and higher levels have Alpine vegetation (Coniferous).
		- The Himalayan forests provide fuel wood and a large variety of timber for industries
		- Himalayan forests host wide variety of medicinal plants
	- Agriculture
		- Tea is a unique crop which can be grown only on the Shiwalik hill slopes in the region
		- Fruit cultivation is a major occupation. A wide variety of fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, mulberry, walnut, cherries, peaches, apricot, etc. are also grown in the Himalayan region.
	- Tourism
		- Himalayan ranges have a large number of tourist spots
		- Srinagar, Dalhousie, Dharamshala, Chamba, Shimla, Kulu, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, Ranikhet, Almora, Darjeeling, Mirik, Gangtok, etc. are important tourist centres in the Himalayas.
	- Mineral Resources in Himalayas
		- Geosynclinal deposits in tertiary rocks are regions of potential coal and oil reserves
		- Coal is found in Kashmir, Copper, lead, zinc, gold, silver, limestone, semi-precious and precious stones occur at some places in the Himalayas
