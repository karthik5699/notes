# Rainforest Climate

- Koeppen’s scheme Of Classification Of Climate
	- Koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate. 
	- He selected certain values of temperature and precipitation and related them to the distribution of vegetation and used these values for classifying the climates.
	- Koeppen recognized five major climatic groups, four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715155113.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715155133.png]]
	- The capital letters : A, C, D and E delineate humid climates and B dry climates
	- The seasons of dryness are indicated by the small letters : f, m, w and s, where f corresponds to no dry season, m – monsoon climate, w – winter dry season and s – summer dry season
	- The small letters a, b, c and d refer to the degree of severity of temperature.
- Group A : Tropical Humid Climates
	- Tropical humid climates exist between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn
	- The sun being overhead throughout the year and the presence of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (INTCZ) make the climate hot and humid.
	- Annual range of temperature is very low and annual rainfall is high
	- The tropical group is divided into three types: Af – Tropical wet climate, Am – Tropical monsoon climate, Aw – Tropical wet and dry climate
		- Tropical Wet Climate (Af)
			- ![[Pasted image 20250715155517.png]]
			- Also known as ‘The Hot, Wet Equatorial Climate’, ‘Equatorial Rainforest Climate’.
			- Distribution
				- Mostly between 5° N and S of Equator.
				- Its greatest extent is found in the lowlands of the Amazon, the Congo, Malaysia and the East Indies
			- Equatorial Climate
				- Dominated by Maritime Tropical air masses
				- Temperature
					- Temperature is uniform throughout the year.
					- The mean monthly temperatures are always around <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">27° C</mark> with very little variation
					- There is no winter
					- Cloudiness and heavy precipitation moderate the daily temperature
					- Regular land and sea breezes assist in maintaining a truly equable climate
					- The diurnal range of temperature is small, and so is the annual range
				- Precipitation
					- Precipitation is heavy and well distributed throughout the year.
					- Annual average is always above 150 cm. In some regions the annual average may be as high as 250 – 300 cm
					- There is no month without rain (distinct dry season is absent)
					- There are two periods of maximum rainfall, April and October (shortly after equinoxes)
					- The double rainfall peaks coinciding with the equinoxes are a characteristic feature of equatorial climates not found in any other type of climate.
					- There is much evaporation and convectional air currents are set up, followed by heavy thunderstorms in the afternoons.
			- Equatorial Vegetation
				- High temperature and abundant rainfall support a luxuriant tropical rain forest.
				- In the Amazon lowlands, the forest is so dense that it is called ‘selvas’
				- The equatorial vegetation comprises a multitude of evergreen trees that yield tropical hardwood, e.g. mahogany, ebony, dye woods etc
				- Many parts of the tropical rain forests have been cleared either for lumbering or shifting cultivation
				- In the coastal areas and brackish swamps, mangrove forests thrive
				- Canopy
					- ![[Pasted image 20250715161111.png]]
					- From the air, the tropical rain forest appears like a thick canopy of foliage, broken only where it is crossed by large rivers or cleared for cultivation
					- All plants struggle upwards (most epiphytes) for sunlight, resulting in a peculiar layer arrangement
						- Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, typically trees, without drawing nutrients from them, using their host for physical support
				- Multiple species
					- Though the tropics have great potential in timber resources, commercial extraction is difficult.
					- Multiple species of trees occur in a particular area making commercial exploitation a difficult task
					- It is therefore not surprising that many tropical countries are net timber importers
			- Life and Economy
				- Agriculture
					- The forests are sparsely populated.
					- In the forests most primitive people live as **hunter gatherers** and the more advanced ones practice **shifting cultivation.**
					- In the **Amazon basin** the **Indian tribes** collect wild **rubber**
					- in the Congo Basin the **Pygmies** gather nuts and
					- in the jungles of Malaysia the **Orang Asli** make all sorts of cane products and sell them to people in villages and towns.
				- Plantation Boom in Rainforests
					- ![[Pasted image 20250715162024.png]]
					- With the coming of the Europeans, many large plantations have been established, especially in Java, Sumatra, Malaysia, West Africa and Central America.
					- The climate is very Favourable for the cultivation of certain crops that are highly valued in the industrial West. The most important is **natural rubber.**
					- **Cocoa** is another important crop which is cultivated in **West Africa**, bordering the **Gulf of Guinea**. The two most important producers are **Ghana and Nigeria**.
					- From the same area another crop, **oil palm**, has done equally well and many countries like Indonesia have now taken to its cultivation.
					- Other important crops include coconuts, sugar, coffee (Brazil), tea, tobacco, spices, etc
					- The plantations resulted in the destruction of nearly half of equatorial forests
			- Factors Affecting the Development of Equatorial Regions
				- Equatorial climate and health
					- Excessive heat (sun-stroke) and high humidity creates serious physical and mental handicaps
					- High humidity feeds many tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow-fever
					- Communicable diseases are rampant as germs and bacteria are transmitted through moist air
					- Insects and pests not only spread diseases but are injurious to crops
				- Jungle hinders development
					- The construction of roads and railways is a risky business as workers are exposed to wild animals, poisonous snakes, insects and most importantly tropical diseases
				- Rapid deterioration of tropical soil
					- The fertility of top soil in rainforest regions is very poor. Torrential downpours wash out most of the top soil nutrients (leaching == percolation and draining way of nutrients due to rain water action)
					- It takes decades to replenish the soil of lost nutrients
					- Indonesian island of Java is an exception because of its rich volcanic ashes.
				- Difficulties in livestock farming
					- Livestock farming is greatly handicapped by an absence of meadow grass. The grass is so tall and coarse that it is not nutritious
			- Mineral resources
				- Gold, copper, diamonds, and other precious metals and gemstones are important resources that are found in rainforests around the world.
				- Extracting these natural resources is a destructive activity that damages the rainforest ecosystem
				- Examples are gold mining in the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon, rare earth mining in the Congo, and gold and copper mining in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.
				- Some of the world’s most promising oil and gas deposits lie deep in tropical rainforests. Oil and gas development often takes a heavy toll on the environment and local people
