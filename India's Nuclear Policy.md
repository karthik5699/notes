# India's Nuclear Policy

India's nuclear policy has been a significant aspect of its external relations and national security, shaped by its commitment to peaceful uses of atomic energy while maintaining strategic autonomy. 

- Foundations and Early Objectives
	- Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, strongly believed in science and technology for building a modern India
	- A significant part of his industrialization plans was the nuclear program, initiated in the late 1940s under the guidance of Homi J. Bhabha
	- The primary objective was to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes
	- Institutional foundations were laid with the establishment of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission in 1948 and the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1954
- The 1974 Nuclear Test
	- In 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests under the leadership of Indira Gandhi
	- India termed this as a "peaceful explosion" and reiterated its policy of using nuclear power exclusively for peaceful purposes
- Stance on Non-Proliferation Treaties
	- India has consistently viewed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 as discriminatory
	- The NPT was imposed by the five permanent members of the UNSC (US, USSR, UK, France, and China), who had already acquired nuclear weapons
	- India argued that the NPT was selectively applicable to non-nuclear powers and served to legitimize the monopoly of the five existing nuclear weapon states
	- Consequently, India refused to sign the NPT and also opposed its indefinite extension in 1995, refusing to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
- The 1998 Nuclear Tests and Aftermath
	- In 1998, India conducted a series of nuclear tests, explicitly demonstrating its capability to use nuclear energy for military purposes
	- Shortly after India's tests, Pakistan also conducted similar nuclear tests, raising concerns about nuclear exchange in the region
	- The international community was highly critical and imposed harsh sanctions on both India and Pakistan
	- Following these tests, India adopted a nuclear doctrine of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"credible minimum nuclear deterrence"</mark> and declared a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"no first use"</mark> policy
	- The Kargil conflict in 1999 drew worldwide attention partly because both India and Pakistan had attained nuclear capability in 1998

Overall, India's nuclear policy has evolved from a focus on peaceful applications and disarmament advocacy to a demonstration of military capability for deterrence, while consistently rejecting discriminatory global non-proliferation regimes
