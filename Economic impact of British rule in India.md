## Questions:

1. Examine critically the various facets of economic policies of the British in India from mid-eighteenth century till independence.
2. Examine how the decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India crippled the rural economy.


# Economic impact of British rule in India

The major difference between the British colonialists in India and early invaders was that the earlier invaders who settled as rulers in India did not generally make any structural changes in Indian economy or drained away India's wealth as tribute. 

A critical examination of the economic policies of the British in India from the mid-eighteenth century till independence reveals a systematic transformation of the Indian economy primarily to serve the interests of Britain.

> At the beginning of the 18th century, India's share in the world economy was some 23%. This share had come down to some 3% by the time India got independence. 

The economic impact of British rule can be understood through distinct phases:

1. Period of Merchant Capital (Mercantilism) (1757-1813)
	- this phase was characterized by the monopoly of trade and the direct appropriation of governmental revenues through control over state power
	- after gaining the Diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1765, the East India Company used the vast revenues of Bengal to purchase goods in India, ending the need to import gold and silver from Britain
	- this period saw a large-scale drain of wealth from India, which constituted a significant portion of Britain's national income and played a crucial role in financing its industrial revolution
	- in this stage yet, there was no large scale import of British manufacturers into India, rather there was an increase in export of Indian textiles
		- however, the weavers were ruined by the Company's monopoly and forced, uneconomic production
	- The dual government system in Bengal (1765-72) led to rampant corruption among Company servants and excessive revenue collection, causing suffering to the peasantry
2. Colonialism of Free Trade (1813-1860s)
	- With the rise of industrial capitalism in Britain, particularly after the Charter Act of 1813 ending the Company's trade monopoly (except with China and in tea), India was transformed into a market for British manufactured goods and a supplier of raw materials
	- This phase was marked by one-way free trade, where cheap, machine-made British imports flooded the Indian market with low tariffs, while Indian products faced high tariffs in Europe
	- This led to the deindustrialisation of India, ruining artisans and handicraft industries
	- To facilitate economic penetration, the administration was made more comprehensive, and modern infrastructure like railways and telegraphs were developed
	- New land revenue systems, such as the Permanent Settlement, Ryotwari, and Mahalwari, were introduced to maximize revenue collection and transform the agrarian structure, leading to the impoverishment of the peasantry
	- Peasants suffered under heavy taxes, rents, illegal levies, and often fell into debt to money-lenders who could manipulate the system and acquire land
3. Era of Foreign Investments and International Competition for Colonies
	- As Britain's industrial supremacy was challenged by other nations, there was a large investment of British capital in India, particularly in railways, loans (to GoI), trade, plantations, mining, jute mills, shipping, and banking
		- there was a rush of foreign capital in India at this time due to prospects of high profits, availability of cheap labour, cheap and readily available raw material, ready market in India and the neighbours, diminishing avenues for investments at home
	- This phase saw strenuous efforts to consolidate British control, partly to secure these investments and keep out rivals
	- Indian-owned industries came up in cotton textiles and jute in the nineteenth century and in sugar, cement, etc., in the twentieth century. Indian-owned industries suffered from many handicapsâ€”credit problems, no tariff protection by Government, unequal competition from foreign companies
	- The economic drain continued through salaries, pensions, interest payments, and profits remitted to Britain
	- The British denied the capacity of Indians for self-governance, advocating for continued 'trusteeship'


Nationalist Critique of Colonial Economy:
- From the mid-19th century onwards, Indian nationalist leaders critically analyzed these policies
- Figures like Dadabhai Naoroji, R.C. Dutt, M.G. Ranade, and G.K. Gokhale exposed the exploitative character of British rule
- their most significant contribution was the "<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">drain theory</mark>," which argued that India's wealth was being systematically transferred to Britain without adequate return, causing India's poverty and economic backwardness
- They criticized the free trade policy and the development of railways as serving British interests, not India's
- This economic critique was fundamental to the national movement, exposing the myth of British benevolence and convincing Indians that poverty was a result of colonial rule, thereby stimulating national unrest and providing a strong ideological base for the struggle


In summary, British economic policies were designed and adapted over time to extract wealth, secure raw materials, create markets for British goods, and provide avenues for British capital investment. This systematically led to the deindustrialisation and impoverishment of India, hindering its potential for independent economic growth and forming a major grievance that fueled the struggle for freedom
