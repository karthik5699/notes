1. Sufis and medieval mystic saints failed to modify either the religious ideas and practices or the outward structure of Hindu / Muslim societies to any appreciable extent. Comment.

# Sufi Movement

In the early centuries of Islam a group of religious-minded people called sufis turned to asceticism and mysticism in protest against the growing materialism of the Caliphate as a religious and political institution. 

Characteristics:
- ultimate goal of Sufism is union with God
	- '<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Wahdat al-Wujud</mark>' holds that all existence is essentially one, a central concept in Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy
- Love of God means love of humanity, service to humanity means service to God
- they rejected elaborate rituals
- their religious outlook borrowed not only from Islam but Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism etc
- they believed in unity of all religions
- they believed in equality of all human beings
- it was a badge of honour for the Sufi to be known as the lover of God

Institutionally, the sufis began to organise communities around the hospice or khanqah (Persian) controlled by a teaching master known as shaikh (in Arabic). Sufi khanqahs provided food, shelter, and guidance, especially to the poor and marginalised.

- Music
	- Sufi silsilas began to crystallise in different parts of the Islamic world around the twelfth century. 
	- The word silsila literally means a chain, signifying a continuous link between master and disciple.
	- **Chishti Silsila:**
		- founded in India by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti
		- Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti established his khanqah in Ajmer to work for the poorest in the society--popularly known as Gharib Nawaz
		- most widespread among the Sufi orders
		- Sheikh Nizamuddin Auliya was one of the renowned Sufi saints of this order
			- Amir Khusrau, the great poet and musician, was his disciple
- Architecture
	- Dargahs like those of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (Ajmer) and Nizamuddin Auliya (Delhi) are masterpieces blending Indo-Islamic styles
- Sufism is remembered as the fountainhead of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb

Limited reform in Muslim society
- Despite the inclusive teachings of Sufis like Nizamuddin Auliya or Muinuddin Chishti, orthodox clergy retained religious authority
- Muslim polity continued to be governed by Sharia-based laws
- Sufis and Bhakti saints focused on personal salvation and did not seek institutional reform

Sufism played a key role in bringing people of different faiths and backgrounds together through its message of love, peace, and devotion. It deeply influenced Indian music, literature, language, and architecture.
