# Continental Drift theory and Post-Drift Studies

- Continental Drift Theory
	- Alfred Wegener proposed that all continents were once part of a single supercontinent called Pangaea, which was surrounded by a mega-ocean named Panthalassa
	- He argued that Pangaea began to split around 200 million years ago, first into two large continental masses: Laurasia (northern component) and Gondwanaland (southern component)
		- These then continued to break into the smaller continents seen today
	- Wegener suggested that the movement responsible for the drifting of the continents was caused by pole-fleeing force (centrifugal force due to rotation of Earth) and tidal force. However, these forces were considered inadequate by most scholars.
- Evidence Supporting Continental Drift
	- Wegener provided various forms of evidence to support his theory.
	- The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Fit): 
		- The shorelines of Africa and South America show a remarkable match
	- Rocks of Same Age Across the Oceans: 
		- 2,000-million-year-old rocks from the Brazil coast match those from western Africa.
	- Tillite:
		- It is the sedimentary rock formed out of deposits of glaciers. 
		- The Gondawana system of sediments from India is known to have its counter parts in six different landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere. 
		- Counter parts of this succession are found in Africa, Falkland Island, Madagascar, Antarctica and Australia besides India. 
		- It clearly demonstrates that these landmasses had remarkably similar histories.
	- Placer Deposits: 
		- Rich gold placer deposits on the Ghana coast lack a source rock in the region, while gold-bearing veins are found in Brazil, implying their origin when the continents were contiguous
	- Distribution of Fossils: 
		- Identical species of land or freshwater plants and animals are found across marine barriers. 
		- For example, Lemurs in India, Madagascar, and Africa led some to propose a landmass called 'Lemuria'.
- Post-Drift Studies and Modern Theories
	- Discoveries made after World War II, especially from ocean floor mapping, provided new insights into the distribution of oceans and continents
	- Convectional Current Theory
		- Arthur Holmes (1930s) suggested that convection currents in the mantle, driven by radioactive elements and thermal differences, could provide the force for continental movement
		- This theory offered a potential explanation for the forces Wegener couldn't adequately account for
	- Mapping of the Ocean Floor
		- Detailed research showed the ocean floor is not a vast plain but has varied relief, including submerged mountain ranges (mid-oceanic ridges) and deep trenches
		- Rocks from the oceanic crust were found to be much younger than continental rocks
		- Rocks equidistant from the crest of mid-oceanic ridges showed similarities in composition, age, and magnetic properties, with younger rocks having normal polarity and being closer to the ridge
			- Paleomagnetism is the study of the record of earthâ€™s magnetic field with the help of magnetic fields recorded in rocks
		- Deep trenches were associated with deep-seated earthquakes, while mid-oceanic ridges had shallow earthquakes
	- Sea Floor Spreading
		- Based on these facts, Harry Hess (1961) proposed the "sea floor spreading" hypothesis
		- When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere
		- Basaltic magma rises from the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seafloor
		- The ocean floor thus spreads, and older crust is consumed where it sinks into oceanic trenches
	- Evidence for Seafloor Spreading
		- The rocks of the oceanic crust near the oceanic ridges are much younger than the rocks of the continental crust.
		- Distribution of Earthquakes and Volcanoes along the mid-ocean ridges
