## Questions:

1. Examine the potential of wind energy in India and explain the reasons for their limited spatial spread.

# Wind Energy

- Introduction
	- Wind energy constitutes about 11% of the country's total installed electricity
	- Wind energy is the second-largest contributor to India’s renewable energy sector after solar power.
	- Over the past decade, wind energy capacity has expanded 2.4 times, whereas solar energy grew 38 times.
- Distribution in India
	- Highest wind energy potential states include the coastal states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.
- Challenges Faced by the Wind Energy Sector
	- Higher Installation Costs: 
		- Lack of local manufacturers and trained workers increases installation costs.
	- Land and site development delays: 
		- Acquiring suitable land is difficult due to fragmented land.
	- Transmission challenges: 
		- India’s grid faces bottlenecks in evacuating wind power due to inadequate transmission lines.
	- Seasonal variability in wind speeds poses challenge for consistent wind energy production.
- Why there is no offshore wind energy production in India?
	- High Costs: 
		- The cost of generating electricity from offshore wind is currently 2-3 times higher than from onshore wind and solar energy in India.
	- Lack of Infrastructure: 
		- India's port infrastructure is not yet equipped to handle the manufacturing, storage, and transport of the massive components required for offshore turbines.
- Government Initiatives to Promote Wind Energy
	- National Offshore Wind Energy Policy 2015: 
		- Targets the development of offshore wind energy.
	- Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for offshore wind energy projects
	- Green Energy Corridors Project: 
		- Strengthens power evacuation and transmission infrastructure for integrating wind and other renewables into the national grid.
	- National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy (2018):
		- Encourages hybridisation of existing wind and solar projects to optimise land use and transmission.
