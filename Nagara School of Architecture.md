# Nagara School of Architecture

Introduction: The Nagara style represents the northern school of temple architecture which flourished prominently from the 5th century onwards, especially under the rule of Guptas and later Rajput dynasties

 - it is common for an entire temple to be built on a stone platform with steps leading up to it
 - the temples generally followed the panchayatan style
 - presence of assembly halls or mandapas in front of principal shrine
 - outside the garbhagriha images of river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna were placed
 - generally built on upraised platforms
 - while the earliest temples had only one shikhara (tower), later temples had several
 - garbhagriha is always located under the tallest shikhara
 - shikharas were generally of 3 types:
	 - Latina or Rekha-prasad: square at the base and walls curve inward to a point on the top
	 - Phamsana: they had broader base and were shorter in height than the Latina ones. they slope upwards on a straight line.
	 - Valabhi: they had a rectangular base with the roof rising into vaulted chambers
 - the vertical end of the Shikhara ended in a horizontal fluted disc, known as the Amalak. on top of that a spherical shape is placed known as kalash
 - ambulatory passageway or pradakshina path around the sanctum sanctorum was covered

3 sub-schools emerged:
1. Odisha School
	- the exterior walls were lavishly decorated with intricate carvings, but interior walls were plain
	- no use of pillars in the porch. Iron girders were used to support the roof.
	- the Shikharas in the Odisha school were known as rekhadeuls. they were almost vertical roofs which suddenly curved inwards sharply.
	- the mandap was known as jagmohan
	- temples were surrounded by boundary wall as in Dravidian style
	- eg: Sun Temple at Konark (Black Pagoda), Jagannath temple at Puri
2. Khajuraho School
	- developed in the central part of India by the Chandela rulers
	- both the interior and the exterior walls were lavishly decorated with carvings
	- sculptures were generally erotic in their themes and drew inspiration from Vatsyayana's Kamasutra
	- features such as sharp noses, prominent chins, long slanting eyes and eyebrows contribute to a lively and assertive depiction of forms
	- made of sandstone material
	- had three chambers -- garbhagriha, mandapa and ardha-mandapa
	- many temples belong to Hindu gods, there are some Jain temples as well
	- eg: Kandariya Mahadeo temple at Khajuraho is the epitome of temple architecture in Central India
3. Solanki School
	- developed in the north-western parts of India including Gujarat and Rajasthan
	- under the patronage of Solanki rulers
	- temple walls were devoid of any carvings
	- garbhagriha is connected with the mandapa both internally and externally
	- a unique feature of this school is the presence of step-tank, known as surya-kund
	- used a variety of material to make temples - sandstones, black basalt and soft-marble
	- east-facing and designed such that every year during equinoxes the sun-rays fall directly into the central shrine
	- eg: Modhera Sun temple, Gujarat


In conclusion, the **Nagara school of temple architecture** is a key part of North Indiaâ€™s temple-building tradition. Known for its **curved shikhara**, **square sanctum**, and **absence of elaborate boundary walls**, it evolved through regional styles like _Odisha_, _Khajuraho_, and _Solanki_. These temples reflect the **religious beliefs, artistic skills, and cultural values** of their time. Even today, they stand as important examples of how architecture can express both **spiritual meaning and social identity**.
