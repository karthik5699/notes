# Fundamental Duties

- Introduction
	- The Fundamental Duties were introduced into the Indian Constitution by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, adding Part IVA and comprising 10 Fundamental Duties. 
	- These were later expanded to 11 duties by the 86th Amendment Act of 2002, which added the duty to provide education opportunities for children
- Nature and Constitutional Position:
	- Unlike Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties are not legally enforceable by the courts
	- Despite their non-justiciable nature, they hold significant **normative, ethical, and civic value**, embodying *constitutional morality* and the ideal of responsible citizenship
- Philosophical Foundations
	- The insertion of Fundamental Duties was inspired by the Soviet constitutional model
	- Their underlying rationale deeply resonates with Gandhian ethics and the Bhagavad Gita's emphasis on Dharma (duty)
		- Gandhi, "the true source of light is duty; if we all discharge our duties, rights will not be far to see"
- Enumerated Article 51A

	11. To provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen years.
- Case laws
	- In _AIIMS Students' Union case (2001)_, the Supreme Court stated that Fundamental Duties should not remain mere aspirations but must be infused into the legal consciousness
- Limitations and Challenges:
	- Lack of Public Awareness
	- The state itself sometimes fails to uphold constitutional morality, weakening the legitimacy of calls for citizen duties
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, Fundamental Duties are an essential component of India's constitutional vision, aiming to foster responsible and participatory citizenship
