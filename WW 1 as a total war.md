## Questions:

1. Why is the First World War considered as the first 'total' war in modern history?

# WW 1 as a total war

- Introduction
	- A "total war" is one in which a nation commits all available resources (human, industrial, economic, and technological) to the war effort, blurring the lines between combatants and civilians and disregarding laws of war. 
	- The First World War is widely considered as the first ‘total war’ in modern history
- Why WWI qualifies
	- Mass conscription
		- Millions of men drafted into armies; women filled industrial, agricultural, and clerical roles to replace them
		- Example: Britain introduced conscription in 1916, a first in its modern history.
	- Economic mobilization
		- Factories converted to produce weapons, shells, aircraft
		- Government rationing of food, coal, and raw materials
		- Finance systems geared toward war bonds and taxation
	- Civilian targets
		- Naval blockades (e.g., Britain against Germany) starved populations as a deliberate tactic
		- German U-boat warfare targeted civilian merchant ships.
	- Propaganda and information control
		- States censored press, produced patriotic media, and demonized the enemy
		- Art, literature, and cinema turned into war tools
	- Global reach
		- Colonial troops from Africa, Asia, and Oceania brought into the European war
		- Battles stretched from the Western Front to the Middle East, Africa, and the Pacific.
- In short, WWI wasn’t fought only in the mud of Flanders; it was fought in factories, kitchens, classrooms, newspapers, and on farms — making it one of history’s first truly “total” wars.
