1. Write a critical note on the evolution and significance of the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan”.

# Jai Jawan Jai Kisan

The slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan” (Hail the Soldier, Hail the Farmer) was famously coined by Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri during his brief tenure from 1964 to 1966. This slogan held significant importance as it symbolized India's resolve to address two major challenges the country faced during that period:
- Economic Challenges
	- India was grappling with the economic aftermath of the 1962 war with China. 
	- This was compounded by failed monsoons, drought, and a severe food crisis. 
	- The "Jai Kisan" part of the slogan emphasized the critical role of farmers in achieving food self-sufficiency and bolstering the nation's economy amidst these difficulties
- External Conflict: 
	- India also faced a war with Pakistan in 1965. The "Jai Jawan" component of the slogan highlighted the valour and importance of soldiers in defending the country's territorial integrity and ensuring national security

The slogan's significance lies in its ability to encapsulate the nation's determination to overcome both internal economic hardships and external military threats simultaneously. It served as a powerful unifying call by linking the efforts of the armed forces with those of the agricultural sector, portraying them as the dual pillars of national strength and self-reliance
