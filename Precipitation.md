# Precipitation

- Introduction
	- The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall on to the earth’s surface. 
	- So after the condensation of water vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation. This may take place in liquid or solid form.
	- Precipitation in the form of drops of water is called rainfall
	- It is called virage when raindrops evaporate before reaching the earth while passing through dry air.
	- When the temperature is lower than the 0° C, precipitation takes place in the form of fine flakes of snow and is called snowfall
	- Besides rain and snow, other forms of precipitation are sleet and hail
		- **Sleet** is frozen raindrops
		- Raindrops, which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are formed. Sometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and which reach the surface of the earth are called **hailstones**.
- Types of Rainfall
	- Conventional Rainfall
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710151351.png]]
		- The, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed. 
		- This process releases latent heat of condensation which further heats the air and forces the air to go further up.

		- Convectional precipitation is heavy but of short duration, highly localised and is associated with minimum amount of cloudiness. 
		- It occurs mainly during summer and is common over equatorial doldrums in the Congo basin, the Amazon basin and the islands of south-east Asia.
	- Orographic Rainfall
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710151620.png]]
		- When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands (because of fall in pressure); the temperature falls, and the moisture is condensed.
		- This type of precipitation occurs when warm, humid air strikes an orographic barrier (a mountain range) head on. Because of the initial momentum, the air is forced to rise. 
		- As the moisture laden air gains height, condensation sets in, and soon saturation is reached. The surplus moisture falls down as orographic precipitation along the windward slopes.
		- The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the **windward slopes** receive greater rainfall. 
			- After giving rain on the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they descend, and their temperature rises. 
			- Then their capacity to take in moisture increases and hence, these **leeward slopes** remain rainless and dry. 
			- The area situated on the leeward side, which gets less rainfall is known as the **rain-shadow area** 
				- Some arid and semi-arid regions are a direct consequence of rain-shadow effect. 
				- Example: **Patagonian desert in Argentina, Eastern slopes of Western Ghats**. 
					- ![[Pasted image 20250710152052.png]]
		- It is also known as the **relief rain.**
		- Example: Mahabaleshwar, situated on the Western Ghats, receives more than 600 cm of rainfall, whereas Pune, lying in the rain shadow area, has only about 70 cm.
		- The Wind Descending on the Leeward Side is heated adiabatically and is called Katabatic Wind
	- Frontal Precipitation
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710152340.png]]
		- When two air masses with different temperatures meet, turbulent conditions are produced. Along the front convection occurs and causes precipitation
	- Cyclonic Rain
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710152437.png]]
		- Cyclonic Rainfall is **convectional rainfall on a large scale**
		- The precipitation in a tropical cyclone is of convectional type while that in a temperate cyclone is because of frontal activity.
	- Monsoon Rainfall
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710152757.png]]
		- This type of precipitation is characterized by **seasonal reversal of winds** which carry oceanic moisture (especially the south-west monsoon) with them and cause extensive rainfall in south and southeast Asia
- World Distribution of Rainfall
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710152937.png]]
	- Different places on the earth’s surface receive different amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons. 
	- In general, as we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall goes on decreasing steadily.
	- The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of the continents. 
	- The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world because of being great sources of water.
	- Between the latitudes 35° and 40° N and S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west
		- Warm Ocean Currents on the Eastern Coasts
		- Cold Ocean Currents on the Western Coasts
	- But, between 45° and 65° N and S of equator, due to the **westerlies**, the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east.
