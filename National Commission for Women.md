# National Commission for Women

- Introduction
	- The National Commission for Women (NCW), established as a statutory body under the NCW Act, 1990, is mandated to be the apex watchdog for women's rights. 
	- However, its effectiveness in tackling issues across the public and private spheres has been a mixed bag, often constrained by structural and functional limitations.
- Successes in Public and Private Spheres:
	- **Public Sphere:** 
		- The NCW has been instrumental in reviewing legislation and recommending amendments to laws like the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, and the PCPNDT Act 1994. 
		- It has played a role in investigating issues of workplace sexual harassment and pushing for policy interventions.
	- **Private Sphere:** 
		- Through its complaints and counselling cell, it has addressed thousands of cases related to domestic violence, property disputes, and dowry harassment. 
		- It has also taken _suo motu_ cognizance of heinous crimes, creating public pressure.
- Reasons for Limited Efficacy:
	- **Advisory Role:** 
		- Its recommendations are not binding on the government, often rendering it a 'toothless tiger' unable to enforce accountability.
	- **Structural Dependence:** 
		- The commission relies on the Ministry of Women and Child Development for financial grants and its members are appointed by the central government, leading to perceptions of political interference and impacting its autonomy.
- Steps for Constitutionalization:
	- The process is governed by Article 368 of the Constitution and involves:
		- **Introduction of a Bill:** 
			- A Constitutional Amendment Bill is introduced in either House of Parliament.
		- **Passage with Special Majority:** 
			- The bill must be passed in each House by a **special majority**, which is a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of at least two-thirds of the members present and voting
		- **Presidential Assent:** 
			- After passage, the bill is presented to the President for assent, which is mandatory
- Impact on Gender Justice and Empowerment:
	- Reasons why it would help:
		- **Enhanced Autonomy:** 
			- It would free the NCW from the administrative control of the Ministry of Women and Child Development and provide financial independence through direct allocation from the Consolidated Fund of India.
		- **Increased Accountability:** 
			- Direct reporting to the Parliament, similar to the CAG or UPSC, would enhance its stature and visibility
	- However, limitations exist:
		- **Not a Silver Bullet:** 
			- Constitutional status alone does not guarantee effectiveness, as seen with the functioning of the NCSC and NCST, which still face challenges in implementation
		- **Deep-Rooted Issues:** 
			- Gender injustice stems from deep-rooted patriarchal and societal norms, which require grassroots-level behavioral change beyond the scope of any commission.
- Conclusion
	- To be truly effective, the NCW needs empowerment through greater financial autonomy, granting its recommendations binding authority, and a more independent appointment process, as suggested by the Parliamentary Committee on Empowerment of Women.
