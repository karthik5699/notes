## Questions:

1. What characteristics of the monsoon climate play a crucial role in sustaining agriculture in Monsoon Asia?

# Monsoon Climate

- Tropical Monsoon Climate
	- Monsoons are land and sea breezes on a much larger scale.
	- Unlike equatorial wet climate, monsoon climate is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons associated with seasonal reversal of winds
	- Floods in wet season and droughts in dry season are common
	- Usually there are three seasons namely summer, winter and rainy season
- Distribution of Tropical Monsoon Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715171859.png]]
	- Occur within 5° to 30° N and S of the equator.
	- On-shore (sea to land) tropical monsoons occur in the summer and off-shore (land to sea) dry monsoons in the winter.
	- They are best developed in <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the Indian sub-continent, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, parts of Vietnam and south China and northern Australia</mark>
- Climate
	- The basic cause of monsoon climates is the difference in the rate of heating and cooling of land and sea
	- In the summer, when the sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, a low pressure is created in Central Asia.
	- The seas, which warm up much slower, remain comparatively at high pressure. 
	- Winds blow outwards as the South-East Monsoon, to Java, and after crossing the equator are drawn towards the continental low pressure area reaching the Indian sub-continent as the South-West Monsoon (Coriolis force)
	- In the winter, conditions are reversed.
	- Temperature
		- Monthly mean temperatures above 18 °C.
		- Temperatures range from 30-45° C in summer. Mean summer temperature is about 30°C.
		- In winters, temperature range is 15-30° C with mean temperature around 20-25° C.
	- Precipitation
		- Annual mean rainfall ranges from 200-250 cm. In some regions it is around 350 cm
		- Places like Cherrapunji & Mawsynram receive an annual rainfall of about 1000 cm. (They lie on the windward side of the Meghalaya hills, so the resulting orographic lift (orographic rainfall) enhances precipitation. Also, they are located between mountains which enhances cloud concentration due to funnelling effect)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250715172954.png]]
	- Seasons
		- The cool, dry season (October to February)
			- Out blowing dry winds, the North-East Monsoon, bring little or no rain to the Indian sub-continent
			- However, a small amount of rain falls in Punjab from cyclonic sources (Western Disturbances: Frontal precipitation brought by [[Jet streams]]) and this is vital for the survival of winter cereals
			- North-East Monsoons blowing over the Bay of Bengal acquires moisture and bring rains to the south-eastern tip of the peninsula at this time of the year
		- The hot dry season (March to mid-June)
			- The temperature rises sharply with the sun’s northward shift to the Tropic of Cancer.
			- Day temperatures of 35° C are usual in central India and the mean temperature in Sind and south India may be as high as 44° C
			- Coastal districts are a little relieved by sea breezes. There is practically little rain.
		- The rainy season (mid-June to September)
			- With the ‘burst’ of the South-West Monsoon in mid-June, torrential downpours sweep across the country. Almost all the rain (80%) for the year falls within this rainy season.
			- This pattern of concentrated heavy rainfall in summer is a characteristic feature of the Tropical Monsoon Climate.
		- The Retreating Monsoon
			- The amount and frequency of rain decreases towards the end of the rainy season. It retreats gradually southwards after mid-September until it leaves the continent altogether.
			- The skies are clear again and the cool, dry season returns in October, with the out blowing North-East Monsoon
	- The role of monsoons in India is vital for its economy.
		- Rain-fed agriculture: Roughly half of India’s net sown area depends directly on rainfall.
		- Groundwater recharge: Monsoons replenish aquifers that are tapped for irrigation in the dry season
		- River flow & irrigation canals: Monsoon-fed rivers (Ganga, Brahmaputra, Godavari, etc.) provide surface water for large irrigation networks.
- Tropical Marine Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715171859.png]]
	- Outside the monsoon zone, the climate is modified by the influence of the on-shore Trade Winds all the year round. 
	- This type of climate is called Tropical Marine Climate. Such a climate has a more evenly distributed rainfall.
	- Such a climate is experienced in <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Central America, West Indies, north-eastern Australia, the Philippines, parts of East Africa, Madagascar, the Guinea Coast and eastern Brazil</mark>
	- The rainfall is both orographic where the moist trades meet upland masses as in eastern Brazil, and convectional due to intense heating during the day and in summer
	- Its tendency is towards a summer maximum without any distinct dry period.
	- Due to the steady influence of the trades, the Tropical Marine Climate is more Favourable for habitation, but it is prone to severe tropical cyclones, hurricanes or typhoons.
- Tropical Monsoon Forests
	- Drought-deciduous forest; dry forest; dry-deciduous forest
	- Broad-leaved hardwood trees. Well developed in southeast Asia.
	- Trees are normally deciduous, because of the marked dry period, during which they shed their leaves to withstand the drought (They shed their leaves to prevent loss of water through **transpiration**)
	- The forests are more open and less luxuriant than the equatorial jungle and there are far fewer species.
	- With a decrease in rainfall in summer, the forests thin out into thorny scrubland or savanna with scattered trees and tall grass
	- In parts of the Indian sub-continent, rainfall is so deficient that semi-desert conditions are found in summer. Monsoonal vegetation is thus most varied, ranging from forests to thickets, and from savanna to scrubland
- Population and Economy in Monsoon Climate
	- Monsoon climatic regions support high population density.
	- Subsistence farming is the main occupation.
	- Intensive cultivation is common in regions with irrigational facilities
	- Shifting cultivation is followed in North-East India and South-East countries
	- Major crops include rice, sugar, cotton, jute, spices, etc.
- Highland plantation crops
	- The colonization of tropical lands by Europeans gave rise to a new form of cultivated landscape in the cooler monsoonal highlands.
	- Thousands of acres of tropical upland forests were cleared to make way for plantation agriculture in which tea and coffee are the most important crops.
	- Coffee
		- Coffee originated in Ethiopia and Arabia
		- But Brazil accounts for almost half the world’s production of coffee
		- It is mainly grown on the eastern slopes of the Brazilian plateau
	- Tea
		- It requires moderate temperatures (about 15° C), heavy rainfall (over 150 cm) and well drained highland slopes
		- It thrives well in the tropical monsoon zone (highlands)
		- The best regions are thus the Himalayan foothills of India and Bangladesh, the central highlands of Sri Lanka and western Java
- Lumbering
	- Most of the forests yield valuable timber, and are prized for their durable hardwood
	- Lumbering is undertaken in the more accessible areas. This is particularly important in continental South-East Asia
	- Of the tropical deciduous trees, teak, of which Burma is the leading producer, is perhaps the most sought after. It is valuable on account of its great durability, strength, immunity to shrinkage, fungus attack and insects
	- Teak logs are so heavy that they will not float readily on water. It is therefore necessary to ‘poison’ the tree several years before actual felling, so that it is dry and light enough to be floated down the Chindwin and the Irrawaddy (Rivers in Myanmar) to reach the saw mills at Rangoon
		- Burma alone accounts for as much as three – quarters of the world’s production.
		- It is such a durable timber that it is extensively used for ship building, furniture and other constructional purposes
	- Other kinds of timber include Neem, Banyan, Mango, Teak, Sal, Acacia, Eucalyptus
