# Solar Energy

- Introduction
	- India has achieved a historic milestone by crossing 100 GW of solar power capacity
	- Solar energy constitutes about 23% of total installed electricity capacity
	- India targets 450 GW solar capacity by 2030
- Distribution in India
	- Why is there regional variation in solar power development in India?
		- Solar power development in India is highly concentrated. 
		- Northern and Western
			- Rajasthan & Gujarat → top due to arid climate, high insolation, land availability.
			- Palli village in Jammu & Kashmir became a notable example, emerging as India’s first carbon-neutral panchayat by running entirely on solar power
		- Southern and Central
			- TN, AP, Karnataka, Telangana → large solar parks, plus hybrid wind-solar projects.
			- The Omkareshwar Floating Solar Park in Madhya Pradesh is one of Asia’s largest floating solar parks
		- Eastern & Northeastern states → low development due to cloud cover, hilly terrain, land scarcity, weaker transmission infra.
		- **Ladakh** → an exception in the north: high-altitude desert, massive solar potential
		- Reasons:
			- Solar Insolation and Irradiation: 
				- The intensity and duration of sunlight are not uniform across the country.
				- Western regions like Rajasthan and Gujarat, along with parts of the Deccan Plateau, receive the highest solar irradiation, making them naturally more efficient and cost- effective for solar power generation.
			- State-Level Policy and Investment Climate: 
				- State-level policies are crucial for attracting investment. 
				- Leading states were early movers in creating investor-friendly solar policies, offering streamlined land acquisition, subsidies, and stable power purchase agreements.
	- Challenges
		- Land Acquisition: 
			- Large-scale solar farms require vast, contiguous tracts of land, which are often difficult to acquire due to competing demands for agriculture and other uses
		- Import Dependence: 
			- The sector is heavily reliant on imported solar cells and modules, primarily from China, creating supply chain vulnerabilities and economic risks.
		- Grid Integration and Stability: 
			- Solar power is intermittent (only generated during the day) and variable (affected by clouds). 
			- Integrating this fluctuating power into a grid designed for stable, 24/7 supply creates instability.
		- Looming Waste Management Crisis: 
			- Solar panels have a lifespan of 25-30 years. 
			- With the solar boom having started over a decade ago, India faces a massive wave of solar panel waste in the near future.
	- Government Initiatives:
		- Green Energy Corridors: 
			- This initiative focuses on developing dedicated transmission infrastructure to ensure that the power generated from large solar parks can be efficiently transported to the national grid.
		- [[Production Linked Incentive]] (PLI) Scheme: 
			- This scheme aims to boost the domestic manufacturing of solar components like cells and modules, thereby reducing India's dependence on imports.
		- Rooftop and Agricultural Solar Schemes: 
			- Programmes like the PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana (for rooftop solar) and PM-KUSUM (for solar agricultural pumps) are promoting decentralized solar energy generation.
		- One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG)
			- One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) is an initiative to create a trans-national electricity grid for supplying solar power across borders. 
			- The vision is to generate round-the-clock clean energy by connecting regions where the sun is shining to regions where it has set.
		- International Solar Alliance (ISA)
			- Headquartered in India, promoting global solar cooperation.
- Ecological and Economic benefits of solar energy generation in India
	- Ecological Benefits
		- Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
			- Each GW of solar can offset millions of tonnes of carbon over its lifetime
		- Reduced Water Usage
			- Coal and nuclear plants need massive amounts of cooling water. 
			- Solar barely uses any, conserving scarce water in drought-prone regions
		- Land Synergies through Agri-voltaics
			- Solar farms can coexist with agriculture (crops grown under/around panels), improving land productivity
	- Economic Benefits
		- Energy Security & Reduced Imports
			- India imports over 80% of its crude oil and large amounts of coal. 
			- Solar cuts this bill, keeping wealth inside the country
		- Job Creation
			- Solar industry creates employment across installation, manufacturing, maintenance, R&D
		- Decentralised Development
			- Rooftop and micro-grid solar brings power to rural and remote areas without waiting for massive grid expansions, fostering rural entrepreneurship.
		- Stable & Low Operating Costs
			- Once installed, solar plants have near-zero fuel costs, unlike coal/gas plants that depend on fluctuating global prices
		- Long-term Competitiveness
			- Solar is already one of the cheapest sources of power in India, undercutting coal. 
			- This reduces electricity costs for industries and households.
- Conclusion
	- India is moving strongly towards a green future. 
	- After crossing 100 GW of solar power, the country is on track to reach 500 GW of clean energy by 2030 and **net-zero by 2070**
