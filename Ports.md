![[Pasted image 20250911181810.png]]

- Introduction
	- Ports are a crucial component of India's infrastructure, facilitating a significant portion of the country's trade and playing a vital role in its economic development
	- Around 90% of India's external trade by volume and 70% by value are handled by ports.
- Classification of Ports
	- Based on Administration
		- Major Ports: 13 administered by the Central Government
		- Minor Ports: ~200 under respective State Governments.
	- Based on Function
		- Industrial/Commercial ports (Mumbai, Paradip)
		- Strategic ports (Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep).
		- Transshipment hubs (Vizhinjam, Vallarpadam).
- Significance
	- Geostrategic importance
		- Ports are gateways to the Indian Ocean, acting as arcs of communication for trade, energy flows and naval security
		- They strengthen India's role in the blue economy and the wider Indo-Pacific strategy
	- Economic Role
		- Ports are vital nodes in the global value chain, linking Indian manufacturing and services to world markets
	- Transport Efficiency
		- Shipping is the cheapest and cleanest mode of bulk transport
	- Socio-economic Impact
		- Stimulates regional development by attracting industries
		- Generates large scale employment
- India's Port Development
	- Key Initiatives and Projects
		- Sagarmala Program
			- Aim: Port-led economic growth by modernising ports, improving connectivity, promoting coastal shipping & inland waterways, boosting industrialisation, and supporting coastal communities.
			- Backbone of Maritime India Vision 2030 & Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047.
			- Priority is given to private sector participation, with PPP models implemented wherever feasible.
		- Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
			- It has been the cornerstone of India's strategy to modernise its port sector.
			- Began in the mid-1990s with Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority pioneering the first PPP.
			- This success led to broad adoption and today over 51% of major port operate under PPP model, with the government's vision aiming for 100% adoption
			- The development under PPP has primarily followed the Landlord Port Model 
				- Port Authority acts as a regulator and landlord while the private operators handle cargo operations
			- Significant Success
				- Attracted massive private investment leading to development of world class infrastructure (Mundra Port)
				- Significantly increased India's cargo handling capacity (2x in the last decade)
				- Drastically reduced vessel turnaround time (reduced by half in the last 5 years from 62 hrs in 2020 to 30 hrs in 2025)
				- Increased job opportunities and foreign investments
	- Challenges
		- Modal Mix Imbalance
			- Roads continue to be the dominant mode of transporting cargo, followed by rail.
		- Inadequate Draught Levels: 
			- Most Indian container ports lack the minimum depth required for large mother vessels, limiting their potential to become hub ports
		- Weak Connectivity: 
			- Poor hinterland connectivity between production centers and gateway ports leads to higher costs and delays
		- Transhipment Port
			- A significant portion of Indian containers is transshipped through foreign ports like Colombo and Singapore, incurring additional costs and delays
		- Complex Regulations
	- Government Initiatives
		- **Bharatmala & Dedicated Freight Corridors**: 
			- To improve hinterland connectivity
		- Transshipment hubs: 
			- Vizhinjam (Kerala) 
				- India’s first deep-water transshipment port
				- Can handle ultra-large container ships
				- Strategically close to international east–west shipping routes
			- Enayam (Tamil Nadu)
		- PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan: 
			- Integrated multi-modal infrastructure plan to connect roads, rail, ports, airports, and logistics in a unified digital platform.
		- Indian Ports Act 2025
			- Establishes the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) as a statutory consultative body to coordinate between the Centre and coastal States
	- Way Forward
		- Expedite the implementation of Sagarmala
		- Open up India’s dredging market to increase draft depth at ports to attract large vessels and enable them to become hub ports
		- Facilitate access to capital for inland vessels
