## Questions:

1. In what ways did the naval mutiny prove to be the last nail in the coffin of British colonial aspirations in India?


# RIN Mutiny 1946

The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) Mutiny of 1946, involving over 20,000 sailors across multiple ships and shore establishments, was a significant event marking the erosion of British authority in India. Though quickly suppressed, it exposed the fragility of British control post-World War II.

The RIN revolt, starting on February 18, 1946, involved about 1,100 naval ratings who went on strike to protest against:
- racial discrimination
- poor-quality food & inadequate access to medical facilities
- INA Trials: The trials of Indian National Army officers in late 1945, seen as symbols of resistance, ignited nationalist fervor among the sailors
- the use of Indian troops in Indonesia

**Key events during the mutiny**
- the mutineers raised slogans of “Jai Hind,” ‘Inquilab Zindabad,’ and “Quit India,” indicating their desire for Indian independence
- they also adopted the tricolour flag of the Indian National Congress and demanded the release of imprisoned nationalist leaders
- over the next few days, the mutiny spread to ships and bases across the Indian subcontinent, including Karachi, Calcutta, and Cochin
- the RIN revolt was met with significant solidarity from the civilian population. Crowds brought food to the ratings, and shopkeepers invited them to take supplies

**RIN Mutiny Failure**
- Mahatma Gandhi strongly condemned the mutiny, criticizing the strikers for acting without the guidance of recognized political leaders
- Similarly, the Muslim League disapproved of the mutiny

**RIN Mutiny Aftermath**
- The upsurges, including the RIN revolt, are cited as prompting the British to extend concessions
	- only those INA members accused of murder or brutal treatment of fellow prisoners would be brought to trial
	- remitting imprisonment sentences for the first batch of INA members
	- withdrawing Indian soldiers from Indo-China and Indonesia
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">the announcement of the Cabinet Mission</mark>


As Clement Attlee later acknowledged, the mutiny, along with the INA trials and Quit India Movement, _accelerated British withdrawal plans_.
