# British Type Climate

- Introduction
	- Westerlies come all the year round
	- There is a tendency towards an autumn or winter maximum of rainfall.
	- Light snow falls in winter.
	- The seasons are very distinct
	- They are the regions of frontal cyclonic activity [[Temperate Cyclones]]
	- This type of climate is typical to Britain, hence the name ‘British Type’.
- Distribution

- British Type Climate
	- Moderately warm summers and fairly mild winters
	- Rainfall occurs throughout the year with winter maxima
	- Temperature
		- The mean annual temperatures are usually between 5° C and 15° C.
		- Winters are abnormally mild. This is because of the warming effect brought by warm North Atlantic Drift
		- Sometimes, unusual cold spells are caused by the invasion of **cold polar continental air ([[Polar Vortex]])** from the interiors
	- Precipitation
		- The British type of climate has adequate rainfall throughout the year with a tendency towards a slight winter maximum (due to frontal cyclones)
		- Western margins have the heaviest rainfall due to westerlies.

		- Relief can make great differences in the annual amount. This is particularly significant in New Zealand where the western margins are subjected to heavy orographic rainfall whereas the eastern Canterbury plains receive comparatively less rainfall due to rain-shadow effect.
	- The seasons
		- As in other temperate regions there are four distinct seasons.
		- This type of climate with its four distinct seasons is something that is conspicuously absent in the tropics.
- Natural Vegetation in British Type Climate
	- The natural vegetation of this climatic type is **deciduous forest.**
	- The trees shed their leaves in the **cold season.**
	- This is an adaptation for protecting themselves against the winter snow and frost
	- Some of the common species include oak, elm, ash, birch, beech, and poplar.
	- In the wetter areas grow willows (Light weight cricket bats are made from willows. In India willows are found in Kashmir).
- Economy in British Type Climate
	- Lumbering is quite profitable
		- Unlike the equatorial forests, the **deciduous trees** occur in **pure stands** and have greater lumbering value
		- **Easy penetration** means much cost can be saved in the movement of the logs.
		- Higher up the mountains, **conifers (softwood)** are felled and transported to **paper and pulp industry**
	- Industrialization
		- The regions are highly industrialized with high standard of living.
		- Fishing is particularly important in Britain, Norway and British Columbia.
		- Ruhr region in Germany, Yorkshire, Manchester and Liverpool regions in Britain are significant for wide ranging manufacturing industries
	- Dairying
		- The temperate western margin type of climate is almost ideal for intensive dairying.
		- Cheese is a specialized product of the Netherlands.
