1. Do you think that constitution of India does not accept principle of strict separation of powers rather it is based on the principle of ‘checks and balance’? Explain.

# Separation of powers

- Introduction
	- The Constitution of India does not accept the principle of strict separation of powers; rather, it is fundamentally based on the principle of 'checks and balances'
- Concept
	- Pragmatic, Not Doctrinaire, Separation of Powers
		- The Indian Constitution, through its adoption of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a parliamentary system, independent judiciary, and federal executive</mark>, reflects a commitment to the separation of powers in a "pragmatic, rather than doctrinaire, manner"
		- Unlike systems that aim for a rigid division (such as the American model inspired by Montesquieu), the Indian system acknowledges the fusion of powers inherent in parliamentary governance 
		- This means there is some overlap in functions, particularly between the executive and the legislature, as the executive is drawn from and collectively responsible to the legislature
	- Institutional Checks and Balances: 
		- Despite this functional overlap, the principle of checks and balances remains integral to maintaining institutional equilibrium and preventing the concentration of power in any single branch. 
		- This system ensures that all branches—legislature, executive, and judiciary—are accountable to each other and operate within constitutional limits
- Key Mechanisms Illustrating Checks and Balances:
	- Judicial Review: 
		- The Indian judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, is empowered by Articles 32 and 226 to enforce constitutional rights and review legislative and executive actions
		- It acts as a "counter-majoritarian check" on parliamentary overreach
	- Basic Structure Doctrine: 
		- A cornerstone of Indian constitutionalism, the Basic Structure Doctrine asserts that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 is not unlimited
	- Supremacy of the Constitution: 
		- India operates on the principle of constitutional supremacy, not parliamentary sovereignty
		- This means that Parliament, while supreme in its legislative domain, is ultimately a "creature of the Constitution" and must operate within its framework
	- Checks on Executive Power: 
		- The judiciary has often acted as a check on executive arbitrariness through judicial activism, upholding constitutional morality and expanding the scope of fundamental rights
		- Cases like S.R. Bommai (1994) have curtailed the executive's arbitrary use of Article 356 (President's Rule)
	- Accountability of Constitutional Bodies: 
		- Institutions like the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) are designed with constitutional mandates to ensure transparency and accountability, providing checks on both the executive and legislative processes
	- Legislative and Executive Accountability: 
		- The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, meaning the executive must maintain the confidence of the legislature
		- Parliament scrutinizes the executive through 
			- Deliberation and Debate
				- The Question Hour is the most effective method of keeping vigil on the executive
				- Other instruments like zero hour, adjournment motions compel the government to explain its policies and actions
			- Approval or Refusal of Laws
				- A bill can become a law only with the approval of the parliament.
			- Financial Control
				- Preparation and presentation of budget for the approval of the legislature is the constitutional obligation of the government.
				- Committees like the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee scrutinises how the government spends money
			- No confidence motion
				- The most powerful weapon that enables the parliament to ensure executive accountability
- Conclusion
	- In essence, the Indian constitutional design deliberately eschews a rigid separation of powers, particularly between the executive and legislative branches, in favour of an intricate system of checks and balances where each organ of the state can scrutinize and constrain the actions of the others to maintain the democratic framework and prevent authoritarian tendencies
