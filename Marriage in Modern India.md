1. Do you think marriage as a sacrament is losing value in Modern India?

# Marriage in Modern India

- Introduction
	- In traditional India, particularly among Hindus, marriage is considered a sacrosanct -- a sacred bond for life, not merely a social contract.
	- However, in Modern India, this traditional notion is being challenged and redefined.
- Challenges to Sacrosanct nature of marriage
	- **Shift in Purpose and Aim:** 
		- Traditionally, especially among Hindus, the primary objective of marriage was 'dharma' or duty. 
		- However, in modern times, the objective has increasingly shifted towards 'life-long companionship' between husband and wife
	- Rise of Individualism
		- Modern values of individual freedom, autonomy, economic independence of women, and the decline of joint family system have reduced social control and made it easier to exit a marriage.
	- Legal reforms
		- The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which introduced divorce, legally challenged the idea of an 'indissoluble' bond.
		- Live-in relationships have received legal recognition by the Supreme Court
	- Increased Divorce and Desertion Rates: 
		- There has been an increase in divorce and desertion rates, particularly in urban areas. 
		- This is attributed to relaxed legislative provisions for divorce and the exposure to different social trends globally
- Continuity and Persistence of Marital Values
	- Despite significant changes in practices, customs, and forms, the basic religious beliefs associated with marriage have not crumbled down
	- Marriage continues to be more or less a universal social institution in India
	- Even with the rise of modern thinking, family life generally remains bound by traditional value and belief systems
	- Individuals are making more informed conscious choices, which can lead to more stable and meaningful relationships. 
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, while the rigid traditional definition of marriage as a sacrament is certainly eroding, the institution itself is not losing value, instead it is being redefined.
