# Indian Climate

- Introduction
	- India’s climate closely resembles the climate of a tropical country, although its northern part (north of the Tropic of Cancer) is situated in the temperate belt.
	- The Indian climate, to be precise, is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">tropical monsoon type</mark> (a distinct wet and dry climate) rather than just a tropical or half-temperate climate
- Factors Influencing Indian Climate
	- Latitudinal location
		- Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer are in the tropics and hence receive high solar insolation. The summer temperatures are extreme, and winter temperatures are moderate in most of the regions.
		- The northern parts, on the other hand, lie in the warm temperate zone. They receive comparatively less solar insolation. But summer is equally hot here because of the hot local wind called the loo. Winter here is very cold due to cold waves brought by the western disturbances.
	- Distance from the Sea
		- Coastal regions have a moderate or equable or maritime climate
		- The monsoon winds first reach the coastal regions and hence bring a good amount of rainfall.
	- Himalayas
		- The Himalayas act as a climatic divide between India and Central Asia
		- During monsoon months, these mountain ranges act as an effective physical barrier for rain-bearing south-west monsoon winds
		- The Himalayas divide the Bay of Bengal branch of monsoon winds into two branches — one branch flowing along the plain regions towards north-west India and the other towards South-East Asia.
		- If the Himalayas were not present, the monsoon winds would move into China, and most of north India would have been a desert.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Why does rainfall decrease from east to west in the plains region (Indus-Ganga Plains)?</mark>
			- As the monsoon winds move from east to west, the moisture levels decrease due to successive rainfall at each low-pressure region
			- By the time winds reach the western parts of the plains (Delhi, Haryana, etc.,) all the moisture in the monsoon winds is exhausted.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> Then how come Haryana and Punjab are not deserts like Rajasthan?</mark>
			- They receive rainfall due to Western Disturbances in winter
	- Physiography
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Why are some parts of peninsular India semi-arid?</mark>
			- Places on the windward side of an orographic barrier receive a great amount of rainfall, whereas those on the leeward side remain arid to semi-arid due to the rain-shadow effect.
			- Vast areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu lie in the rain-shadow or leeward side of the Western Ghats and receive scanty rainfall
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Why is there no significant rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan? (Explain the formation of the Thar Desert.)</mark>
			- Monsoon winds flowing in Rajasthan and Gujarat are not obstructed by any orographic barrier, and hence, these regions receive no rainfall.
			- Monsoon winds blow almost parallel to Aravallis, and also, they are not of imposing height to cause an orographic effect except for some places like Mount Abu; hence, there is no orographic rainfall.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">How come Cherrapunji and Mawsynram receive abnormally high rainfall?</mark>
			- Mawsynram and Cherrapunji (both places in Khasi Hills, Meghalaya) are the wettest places on earth, with a mean annual rainfall of over 1100 cm
			- ![[Pasted image 20250814154856.png]]
			- Copious rainfall in these places is due to the funnelling effect followed by orographic upliftment — the monsoon winds, saturated with moisture, are forced to ascend as they encounter the steep slopes of the Khasi Hills.
	- Monsoon Winds
		- The most dominating factor of the Indian climate is the 'monsoon winds'. 
		- Important features of Indian Monsoons are
			- Sudden onset (sudden burst)
			- Gradual progress
			- Gradual retreat
			- Seasonal reversal of winds
	- Upper-Air Circulation
		- The changes in the upper air circulation over Indian landmass are brought about by Jet streams
		- Westerly jet stream blows at a very high speed during winter over the sub-tropical zone
		- The southern branch of the jet stream exercises a significant influence on the winter weather conditions in India. 
		- This jet stream is responsible for bringing western disturbances from the Mediterranean region into the Indian sub-continent
		- The reversal in upper air circulation takes place in summer due to the apparent shift of the sun's vertical rays in the northern hemisphere.
		- The westerly jet stream is replaced by the easterly jet stream, which owes its origin to the heating of the Tibet plateau. This helps in the sudden onset of the south-west monsoons.
	- Western Disturbances
		- ![[Pasted image 20250814155652.png]]
		- The arrival of these temperate storms (remnants of temperate cyclones) causes precipitation, leading to an abrupt decrease in air temperature over North-West India.
		- Winter rain and heat storms in north-western plains, occasional heavy snowfall in hilly regions, and cold waves in the northern plains are caused by these disturbances.
		- The western disturbances affect weather conditions during the winter season up to Patna (Bihar) and give occasional rainfall, which is highly beneficial for the standing rabi crops (wheat, barley, mustard, gram, lentil, etc.)
	- Tropical Cyclones
		- Tropical cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and influence large parts of peninsular India.
		- Majority of the cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and influence the weather conditions during the south-west monsoon season (low-intensity cyclones).
		- Some cyclones are born during the retreating monsoon season, i.e., in October and November (high-intensity cyclones) and influence the weather conditions along the eastern coast of India
	- El-Nino, La Nina and ENSO
		- El Nino
			- Adversely affects monsoon rainfall and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.
			- Good for cyclogenesis in the Arabian Sea.
			- Droughts are common during El Nino events due to less monsoonal and cyclonic rainfall
		- La Nina
			- Good for monsoons and cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal.
			- Floods are common
		- El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
			- ENSO -> (warm water in eastern Pacific + low pressure over eastern Pacific) + (cool water in western Pacific + high pressure in western Pacific).
			- Climatic conditions are similar to El Nino.
