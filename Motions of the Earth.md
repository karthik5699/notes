# Motions of the Earth

Rotation of Earth
- Earth rotates along its axis from west to east.
- The circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called the circle of illumination
- ![[Pasted image 20250703152950.png]]
- Earth rotates on a **tilted axis**. Earth’s rotational axis makes an angle of **23.5°** with the normal i.e. it makes an angle of **66.5°** with the orbital plane

#### Why are days always longer than nights at the equator?
- If there was no atmosphere, there would be no refraction and the daytime and nighttime would be near equal at the equator
- But due to atmosphere, the sun’s rays gets refracted (bending of light). Refraction is particularly stronger during the morning and the evening time when the sun’s rays are slant.

- Even though the actual sun is below the horizon, its apparent image would appear above the horizon due to refraction. This makes the days longer than nights at the equator.

Revolution of the Earth
- The second motion of the earth around the sun in its orbit is called revolution. It takes **365¼ days** (one year) to revolve around the sun.

- Solstice
	- On 21st June, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer. As a result, these areas receive more heat.
	- The areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting
	- The north pole is inclined towards the sun and the places beyond the **Arctic Circle** experience continuous daylight for about six months.
	- The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June.
	- This position of the earth is called the **summer solstice.**
	- On **22nd December**, the Tropic of Capricorn receives direct rays of the sun as the south pole tilts towards it. 
	- As the sun’s rays fall vertically at the **Tropic of Capricorn** (23½° s), a larger portion of the southern hemisphere gets light. 
	- Therefore, it is summer in the southern hemisphere with longer days and shorter nights.
	- This position of the earth is called the **winter solstice.**
- Equinox
	- On **21st March** and **September 23rd**, direct rays of the sun fall on the equator. At this position, neither of the poles is tilted towards the sun; so, the whole earth experiences equal days and equal nights. 
	- This is called an equinox.


## Personal Analysis:

India’s hottest days are in May, before the monsoon clouds and rains arrive — despite the summer solstice being in June — because dry conditions allow full heating of the land.
