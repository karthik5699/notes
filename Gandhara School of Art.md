# Gandhara Sculpture

Gandhara art, developed during the Kushan period (1st–5th century CE), especially under Kanishka, was a syncretic school that fused Greco-Roman styles with Indian Buddhist themes. It flourished in the regions of present-day northwest Pakistan, with major centres like Taxila and Peshawar.

- The Greek invaders brought with them the traditions of the Greek and Roman sculptors, which influenced the local traditions of the region. Thus Gandhara school came to be known as Greco-Roman School of Art.
- Early Gandhara school used bluish-grey sandstone while the later period saw the use of mud and stucco
- the themes were primarily Buddhist
- Buddha is shown in a spiritual state with wavy hair. He wears fewer ornaments and is seated in the pose of a Yogi.

Greek influence:
- Idealised human form
	- balanced, symmetric body proportions
	- calm, serene facial expressions
- curly hair and wavy locks
	- reminiscent of Apollo and other greek gods
- use of Halo (Nimbus)

Roman influence:
- Realistic anatomy
	- Muscular body and depiction of veins and bone
- heavy drapery with deep folds
- Gandhara artists also adopted architectural elements from Roman structures, including columns and arches

Gandhara art stands as a remarkable fusion — **Greek aesthetics provided form and grace**, while **Roman art contributed realism and narrative depth**, resulting in a uniquely syncretic visual tradition in early Buddhist sculpture.
