# Geomorphic Processes

- Introduction
	- Geomorphology is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">study of nature and origin of landforms</mark>.
	- Earth’s crust and its surface are constantly evolving due to various forces emanating from below (endogenic forces) as well as above the surface of the earth (exogenic forces).
	- These forces cause physical and chemical changes to the earth's surface.
	- Some of these changes are imperceptibly slow (e.g. weathering, folding) 
	- Some others are gradual (e.g. erosion) while the remaining are quite sudden (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions).
	- Geomorphic agents: mobile medium (like running water, moving ice masses or glaciers, wind, waves, currents etc.) which removes, transports and deposits earth materials

- Endogenic Geomorphic Movements
	- The large-scale movements on the earth’s crust due to forces emanating from deep below the earth’s surface are called as endogenic geomorphic movements
	- The ultimate source of energy behind forces that drive endogenic movements is earth’s internal heat.
	- Differences in temperature and pressure among various layers of the earth give rise to density differences and these density differences give rise to conventional currents
	- Convectional currents in the mantle drive the lithospheric plates and the movement of the lithospheric plates (tectonics) is the cause behind endogenic movements.

	- Diastrophism
		- Diastrophism refers to deformation of the Earth’s crust due to diastrophic movements such as folding, faulting, warping (bending or twisting of a large area) and fracturing.
		- All processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism. They include: 
			- Orogenic processes 
				- Involve mountain building through severe folding, faulting, thrusting, often as a result of plate tectonics
			- Epeirogenic processes 
				- Involve uplift or warping of large parts of the earth’s crust. 
				- It is a continental building process. 
				- They involve radial movements (act along the radius of the earth). 
	- Sudden Movements
		- Sudden geomorphic movements occur mostly at the tectonic plate margins
		- Earthquakes
			- [[Earthquakes]] occur when the surplus accumulated stress in rocks in the earth’s interior due to folding, faulting or other physical changes is relieved through the weak zones over the earth’s surface in the form of kinetic energy (seismic waves)
			- Earthquakes may cause a change in contours, change in river courses, shoreline changes, landslides, soil creeps, mass wasting etc
		- Volcanoes
			- Volcanism includes the movement of molten rock (magma) onto or towards the earth’s surface through narrow volcanic vents or fissures
- Exogenic Geomorphic Movements
	- The geomorphic processes on the earth’s crust brought down by the forces emanating from above the earth’s surface (wind, water) are called exogenic geomorphic process.
	- Exogenic geomorphic process gives rise to exogenic movements such as weathering and erosion
	- Exogenic processes are a direct result of the sun’s heat.
	- Sun’s energy dictates the weather patterns like winds, precipitation, etc.
	- Denudation
		- All the exogenic processes (weathering and erosion) are covered under a general term, denudation.
		- The word ‘denude’ means to strip off or to uncover.
	- Weathering
		- Weathering is the disintegration of rocks, soil, and minerals under the influence of physical (heat, pressure) and chemical (leaching, oxidation and reduction, hydration) agents.
		- As very little or no motion of materials takes place in weathering, it is an in-situ or on-site process
		- The weathered material is carried farther away by erosion.
		- There are three major groups of weathering processes: 
			1) Physical
				- Physical weathering involves **mechanical disintegration** of rocks due to temperature changes, wet-dry cycles, crystallisation of salts, animal and plant activity, etc.
				- Types
					- Exfoliation due to thermal stress weathering
						- Thermal stress weathering results from the subsequent expansion and contraction of rocks caused by diurnal and seasonal variations in the temperatures
					- Exfoliation due to pressure release or unloading
					- Etc.,
			2) Chemical
				- Chemical weathering involves chemical decomposition of rocks and soil.
				- Chemical weathering processes include 
					- Dissolution
						- Some minerals, due to their natural solubility (like nitrates, sulphates, and potassium) will weather through dissolution naturally (rains).
					- Solution
						- Solution weathering occurs when the solvent is an acidic solution rather than simple water
					- Carbonation
						- Carbonation weathering is a process in which atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to solution weathering.
						- As rain falls, it dissolves small amounts of carbon dioxide from the air, forming a weak acid that can dissolve some minerals like limestone
							- Caves are formed when underground water containing carbonic acid travels through blocks of limestone, dissolves out the limestone, and leaves empty pockets (caves) behind (E.g. Karst topography)
					- Hydration
						- When rock minerals take up water, the increased volume creates physical stresses within the rock.
						- Hydration is reversible, and continued repetition of this process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration
					- Oxidation & Reduction
						- In weathering, oxidation means a combination of a mineral with oxygen to form oxides (rusting in case of iron) or hydroxides. Red soils appear red due to the presence of iron oxides.
						- When oxidised minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent, reduction takes place.
			3) Biological 
				- Biological weathering is the removal of minerals from the environment due to growth or movement of organisms
				- Lichens and mosses grow on essentially bare rock surfaces and create a more humid chemical microenvironment
				- Seedlings sprouting in a crevice and plant roots exert physical pressure as well as providing a pathway for water and chemical infiltration
	- Significance of Weathering
		- Weathering is the first step in the formation of soil from rocks.
		- Weakens soil and rocks and makes it easy to exploit natural resources
		- Leads to natural soil enrichment.
		- Leads to mineral enrichment of certain ores by leaching unwanted minerals leaving behind the valuable ones
