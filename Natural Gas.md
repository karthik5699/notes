## Questions:



# Natural Gas

- Introduction
	- Natural Gas primarily consists of methane and ethane, with smaller amounts of propane, butane, pentane, and hexane also present.
	- Found in sedimentary basins, often with or near oil.
	- India aims to increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030.
- Global Distribution
	- Middle East (~40%)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250913163440.png]]
		- Iran (South Pars field with Qatar), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq
	- Eurasia (~30%)
		- Russia (largest reserves)
	- North America (~6–7%)
		- USA (conventional + shale gas)
		- Canada (Alberta)
	- Africa (~7–8%)
		- Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt
- Shale Gas and Unconventional Sources
	- Extracted through hydraulic fracturing of shale rock.
	- USA, Canada major producers.
	- Reshaped global gas supply; reduced dependence on West Asia.
- India's Plan for a Gas-Based Economy
	- ![[Pasted image 20250913163903.png]]
	- India is actively transitioning towards a gas-based economy to reduce import dependence on crude oil and enhance energy security
	- Key Objectives
		- Reducing Import Dependence:
			- India currently imports ~50% of its natural gas; focus on boosting domestic production and exploration.
		- Increasing Gas Share: 
			- Targeting 15% share in the energy mix by 2030
		- Diversifying Energy Sources: 
			- Reducing coal and oil dependency by promoting natural gas as a cleaner alternative.
	- Hurdles in Expanding the India's Natural Gas Sector
		- Low Domestic Production: 
			- The country's own natural gas production is not keeping up with its growing demand. 
			- This is due to challenges in discovering and developing new gas fields, which forces more reliance on costly imports
		- Lack of Pipelines: 
			- There aren't enough pipelines to transport gas efficiently across the country.
	- Policies to Boost India's Natural Gas Production
		- Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP)
			- Provides a single license to explore and produce all forms of hydrocarbons (oil, gas, shale gas, etc.).
			- Introduced a simpler revenue-sharing model with the government.
		- Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP)
			- Companies can choose exploration blocks at any time (open acreage), instead of waiting for government to auction specific blocks
		- One Nation, One Grid, One Tariff
			- To develop a transparent and integrated gas market
- Geopolitical Significance
	- Pipeline politics: Russia–Europe gas disputes (Nord Stream).
	- LNG trade reduces monopoly of pipeline suppliers.
- Conclusion
	- Natural gas is a cleaner fuel that can aid the energy transition, but its uneven distribution and infrastructure gaps make it both a resource and a challenge for India and the world.
