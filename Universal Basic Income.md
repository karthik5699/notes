## Questions:

1. “Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a viable solution to eradicate extreme poverty in India.” Critically discuss the statement.

# Universal Basic Income

- Introduction
	- A guaranteed, regular payment to every person, in cash, no strings attached, enough to cover basic living needs.
- The fundamental problem it addresses
	- People need a minimum level of resources to survive and participate in the economy
	- The market doesn’t guarantee that everyone gets that minimum (unemployment, automation, economic shocks)
	- Current welfare systems are often **conditional** (you only get help if you qualify) and **complex** (paperwork, bureaucracy, leakages)
- Potential Advantages
	- **Simplicity:** No means testing, less bureaucracy
	- **Freedom:** Recipients choose how to spend
	- Insurance against shocks
	- **Resilience:** People can take risks (start businesses, study) without fear of destitution
- Challenges & Criticism
	- **Cost:** Needs huge funding—where does the money come from?
	- Inflation risk
	- **Work disincentive:** Some may reduce work effort
	- **Inequality**: Rich people also get it
	- **Opportunity cost**: Risk of reducing public investment in health, education, and infrastructure
	- UBI _improves well-being_, but doesn’t magically fix structural issues like poor health systems, education quality, or job creation
- Implementation levers
	- Taxing the rich and wealthy
	- Redirecting subsidies/welfare budgets into one direct payment
- Conclusion
	- UBI shifts the social contract from “You must work to live” to “You live, and you may choose how to work.”
	- UBI has the potential to eliminate extreme poverty, but in India’s present context, a phased and targeted approach—backed by robust public services—offers a more viable pathway than immediate universal implementation
