# Indian constitution as a social document

- Introduction
	- The Indian Constitution is not merely a legal framework but fundamentally a visionary project of social transformation
- Key aspects that highlight the Indian Constitution as a social document:
	- Vision of the Founding Fathers 
		- The Constitution-makers B.R. Ambedkar, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Rajendra Prasad, were acutely aware that political independence would be hollow without achieving social and economic justice
		- Nehru believed that democracy was incomplete without economic justice, advocating for state-led development and planning to uplift the masses
	-  Preamble and Core Values 
		- The Preamble of the Indian Constitution declares India a "Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic" and pledges to secure Justice (social, economic, and political), Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity to all its citizens. 
		- These values are not merely aspirational but serve as ethical anchors for governance
	- Fundamental Rights (Part III)
		- **Article 14** guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of laws
		- **Article 15** prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth
		- **Article 16** ensures equality of opportunity in public employment
		- Article 17 abolished untouchability
		- **Article 21** guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, which has been expansively interpreted by the judiciary to include rights to health, dignity, and livelihood, thereby giving quasi-enforceability to several socio-economic rights
	- Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)
		- Article 38 mandates the state to secure a social order for the promotion of the welfare of the people and reduce inequalities
		- Article 39 directs the state to ensure the equitable distribution of material resources and prevent the concentration of wealth
		- Articles 41-47 cover aspects like education, health, living wages, and nutrition
	- Affirmative Action 
		- The Constitution explicitly provides for reservations in education, employment, and legislatures for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and later Other Backward Classes (OBCs). 
		- This reflects a substantive approach to equality of opportunity, recognizing and addressing structural and historical disadvantages
- Conclusion
	- The Indian Constitution is considered a **"living document"** that continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of society.
