# Final Stages of a Star's Life

In the first part of the final stage of its life, a star enters the red-giant phase where it becomes a red-giant star. After that, depending on its mass, the red-giant star can die out by becoming a white dwarf star, or by exploding as a supernova star, which ultimately ends in the formation of neutron star and black holes.

- Red-Giant Phase
	- Initially, the stars contain mainly hydrogen. With the passage of time, hydrogen gets converted into helium.
	- Now, when all the hydrogen present in the core of the star gets converted into helium, then the fusion reactions in the core would stop.
	- Due to the stoppage of fusion reactions, the pressure inside the core of the star would diminish, and the core would begin to shrink under its own gravity.
	- Meanwhile, in the outer shell of the star, some hydrogen remains, and fusion reactions continue at a reduced intensity
	- Due to all these changes, the overall equilibrium in the star is upset and in order to readjust it, the star has to expand considerably in its exterior region
	- Thus the star becomes very big (it becomes a giant), and its colour changes to red.
	- At this stage, the star enters the red-giant phase and it is said to become a red-giant star.
	- Our Sun is expected to become a red-giant star in approximately 5 billion years
- Formation of White Dwarf Star
	- If the mass of red-giant star is similar to that of the sun, the red-giant star would lose its expanding outer shell or envelope because then the comparatively smaller amount of hydrogen fuel present in it will be used up rapidly, and only the core of the red-giant star will gradually shrink into an extremely dense ball of matter due to gravitation.
	- Because of this enormous shrinking of helium core, the temperature of core would rise greatly and start another set of nuclear fusion reactions in which helium is converted into heavier elements like carbon, and an extremely large amount of energy will be released
	- When the mass of a star is similar to the mass of the sun, then all the helium is converted into carbon in a short time and then further fusion reactions stop completely. Now, as the energy being produced inside the star stops, the core of star contracts (shrinks) under its own weight. And it becomes a white dwarf star.
	- A great Indian scientist Chandrasekhar made a detailed study of the stars which end their lives by becoming white dwarf stars. Chandrasekhar concluded that the start having a mass less than 1.44 times the solar mass (or sun’s mass) would end up as white dwarf stars. 
	- The maximum limit of 1.44 times the solar mass (for a star to end its life as a white dwarf) is known as ‘Chandrasekhar Limit’
- Formation of Supernova Star and Neutron Star
	- When a very big star is in the red-giant phase, then being big, its core contains much more helium. This big core made up of helium continues to contract (shrink) under the action of gravity producing higher and higher temperature.
	- At this extremely high temperature, fusion of helium into carbon takes place in the core and lot of energy is produced. 
	- Since the star was very big and contained enormous nuclear fuel helium, so a tremendous amount of nuclear energy is produced very rapidly which causes the outer shell (or envelope) of this red-giant star to explode with a brilliant flash like a nuclear bomb.
	- This type of ‘exploding star is called supernova.
	- The heavy core left behind after the supernova explosion continues to contract and ultimately becomes a neutron star (if mass of star was 1.44 time to 3 times the Sun) or Black Hole (if the mass of star was more than 3 times the sun).
