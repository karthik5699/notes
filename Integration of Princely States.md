# Integration of Princely States

The integration of princely states was a crucial and challenging aspect of nation-building immediately following India's independence.

- Background and Challenges:
	- In colonial India, nearly 40% of the territory was occupied by 565 small and large states ruled by princes, who had varying degrees of autonomy under British paramountcy
	- Just before independence, the British announced that paramountcy over princely states would lapse, meaning these 565 states would become legally independent
	- The British government took the view that all these states were free to join either India or Pakistan or remain independent if they so wished. 
		- This decision was left not to the people but to the princely rulers of these states
	- Many rulers, such as Travancore, Hyderabad, and Bhopal, publicly declared their desire for independent status, raising the real possibility of India fragmenting into numerous small countries
	- Democracy also looked bleak for the people in these states, as their governments were largely non-democratic, and rulers were unwilling to grant democratic rights
- Government's Approach and Sardar Patel's Role:
	- The interim Indian government adopted a firm stance against the fragmentation of India
	- Sardar Patel, as India's Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, played a historic role in integrating most of these states through skillful persuasion and diplomatic pressure
	- His approach was guided by three main considerations:
		- The people of most of the princely states clearly wanted to become part of the Indian Union
		- The government's willingness to be flexible by granting autonomy to some regions to accommodate plurality
		- In the back drop of Partition, the integration and consolidation of the territorial boundaries of the nation had assumed supreme importance
	- Patel appealed to the princes to accede to India on three common subjects: foreign relations, defence, and communications
	- Lord Mountbatten's speech to the Chamber of Princes was significant in persuading most princes to sign the Instrument of Accession
	- By August 15, 1947, peaceful negotiations had brought almost all contiguous states into the Indian Union, with rulers signing the "Instrument of Accession" to become part of India
- Difficult Cases of Accession
	- Junagadh:
		- Junagadh’s Muslim Nawab chose to accede to Pakistan despite a Hindu majority
		- A popular uprising forced him to flee, after which Indian troops intervened and a 1948 plebiscite confirmed accession to India.
	- Hyderabad
		- The largest princely state, its ruler, the Nizam, claimed independent status
		- A standstill agreement was signed in November 1947, but the Nizam, encouraged by Pakistan, hoped to prolong negotiations to build military strength and potentially accede to Pakistan
		- Within the state, the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (MIM) and its paramilitary wing, the Razakars, grew strong, advocating a Muslim dominion and engaging in violence against the popular movement for democratization led by the Hyderabad State Congress and a Communist-led peasant movement in Telangana
		- Sardar Patel ordered the Indian army to move into Hyderabad in 1948, code-named Operation Polo
		- The Nizam surrendered within three days and acceded to the Indian Union in November 1948, completing the process of princely state accession and marking a triumph for Indian secularism
	- Kashmir:
		- The Hindu ruler, Hari Singh, initially sought an independent status
		- Since majority population of the state was Muslim, the Pakistani leaders thought the Kashmir region 'belonged' to them.
		- The popular movement in the state, led by Sheikh Abdullah, wanted to get rid of the Maharaja, but was against joining Pak.
		- Pakistan sent tribal infiltrators into Kashmir, forcing Maharaja Hari Singh to seek Indian military assistance
		- India agreed to provide military support only after the Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession
		- One part of Kashmir came under Pakistani control, which India considers illegal occupation ("Azad Kashmir")
		- Article 370 of the Indian Constitution granted special status and greater autonomy to J&K, with its own constitution and laws
	- Manipur:
		- Maharaja of Manipur signed the instrument of Accession with the Indian government on the assurance that the internal autonomy of Manipur would be maintained
		- Under public pressure, he held elections in 1948, making Manipur India's first part to hold an election based on universal adult franchise and becoming a constitutional monarchy
		- The Government of India pressurized the Maharaja to sign a Merger Agreement in 1949, without consulting the elected Legislative Assembly
		- The caused a lot anger and resentment in Manipur, the consequences of which are still being felt.
- French and Portuguese Settlements
	- Pondicherry and other French possessions were handed over to India in 1954 after prolonged negotiations
	- Portugal refused to hand over its areas (Goa, Diu, and Daman)
	- There was a independence movement in Goa, India remained patience even in face of Portuguese repression in Goa
	- In 1961, Indian troops marched into Goa under "Operation Vijay". Portuguese authorities surrendered without a fight.
	- Goa remained a Union Territory, and after an "Opinion Poll" in 1967 confirmed the people's desire to maintain a separate Goan identity (opposing merger with Maharashtra), Goa finally became a state of the Indian Union in 1987


The integration of princely states, though a complex and often challenging process, was broadly successful due to a combination of diplomatic skill, popular pressure, and, in some cases, military action, ultimately contributing to the territorial consolidation of independent India.
