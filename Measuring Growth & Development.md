# Measuring Growth & Development

- Introduction
	- GDP, GNP, Potential GDP are traditional indicators of growth and development. 
- Procedure
	- National Income Accounting is a framework for calculating Gross Domestic Product.
		- It’s basically a book-keeping system of the economy
		- Three ways to measure GDP:
			- Production method
				- Sum of value added by all sectors
			- Income method
				- Sum of all incomes generated → wages + rent + interest + profit
			- Expenditure method
				- Sum of all spending → C (Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government spending) + (X–M) (Exports minus Imports)
- Concepts
	- Gross Domestic Product (GDP): 
		- The total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.
	- Gross National Product (GNP): 
		- GDP plus net factor income from abroad.
	- Potential Growth vs Actual Growth
		- Potential growth is the maximum sustainable rate an economy can grow 
		- This theoretical peak is achieved when key growth factors like capital, labor, and technology are all performing optimally.
		- It differs from actual growth, which is the economy's current performance
		- Factors like inadequate infrastructure and low human capital prevent India from realizing its potential GDP.
- Issues with GDP Estimation
	- Data Source Reliability
		- India switched to the MCA-21 database in 2015 to calculate GDP with 2011-12 as the new base year
		- This database tracks company financial performance but was untested for national GDP calculations
		- The untested system led to systematic over-estimation of manufacturing output and investment figures
		- Suspicious jump from -1.9% to 5.4% growth in 2013-14
	- Discrepancies & Volatility
		- The "Discrepancies" component in GDP calculation represents measurement errors and data inconsistencies
		- This component has become increasingly large and volatile -- indicating problems with data quality
		- Discrepancies amounted to 4% of GDP in the year 2023-24
	- Unorganised Sector Issues
		- India's GDP calculation heavily depends on organised sector data
		- Struggles to capture the large unorganised sector
- Issues with GDP as an Indicator for Growth
	- Incomplete well-being
		- GDP measures economic size but fails to capture unemployment, poverty and hunger 
	- Excludes home production
		- GDP ignores unpaid work like household chores, childcare etc
	- Per capita issues
		- GDP masks individual living standards
	- Base effect distortion
		- Growth rates mislead after sharp contractions, creating illusions of fast recovery
	- Ignores externalities
		- GDP doesn't include the environmental costs of development
	- No depreciation accounting
		- GDP ignores depreciation of physical capital like machinery & infrastructure
	- India is considering shifting to a chain-base index for GDP estimates, where comparisons are made with the previous period rather than a fixed base (2011-12), aligning with international practice
- Modern Indicators
	- Recognizing the limitations of GDP as a sole measure of well-being, several alternative indicators have been developed. 
	- These indicators provide a more holistic view of development.
	- Human Development Index (HDI):
		- A composite index measuring average achievement in three key dimensions: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. 
		- In 2025, India's Human Development Index (HDI) rank is 130
	- Gender Inequality Index (GII): 
		- Measures gender inequalities in three important aspects of human development—reproductive health, empowerment, and economic status
	- Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI): 
		- The global MPI identifies acute poverty across 10 indicators in health, education, and standard of living. 
		- It captures both the incidence and intensity of poverty.
		- India's National MPI (NMPI), developed by NITI Aayog, includes two additional indicators: Maternal Health and Bank Account
