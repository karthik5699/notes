## Questions:

1. To what extent has the urban planning and culture of the Indus Valley Civilization provided inputs to the present day urbanization? Discuss.

# Indus Valley Civilisation

The _Indus Valley Civilization (c. 2600–1900 BCE)_, also known as the _Harappan Civilization_, was one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations, contemporary to Mesopotamia and Egypt. Spread over a vast area of modern-day Pakistan and northwest India, it was noted for its planned cities, economic sophistication, and cultural uniformity.

Urban Planning:
- the city was divided into 2 parts: citadel (where rulers lived) and the lower part
- the town planning followed a grid pattern and streets ran from north and cut at right angle. there were lamp posts at intervals
- burnt bricks of good quality were used with an identical ratio of 1:2:4
- they had excellent underground drainage system. all the houses were connected to the drains.
- they were well aware of the principles of water-proofing as the bricks were closely fitted and sealed with mud mortar to prevent leakage
- houses were often of 2 or more storeys, though varied in size but quite monotonous
- they collected rain water in water reservoirs as evident in Dholavira
- they had public spaces like <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the Great Bath of Mohenjodaro</mark> for communal gathering and ritualistic performance
- there were also large garbage cans on the streets that were cleared regularly

Sculptures:
1. Seals
	- Steatite, a soft stone, was the most common material to make seals
	- most seals have inscriptions in pictographic script
	- discovery of seals at Mesopotamia and Lothal suggest seals were extensively used for trade
	- also used as amulets for identification
	- eg: <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Pashupati seal</mark> (deity surrounded by elephant, tiger, buffalo and antelopes)
2. Bronze figures
	- made of lost wax technique or 'Cire Perdue'
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Dancing girl of Mohenjodaro</mark> (world's oldest bronze sculpture) (stands in Tribhanga posture)

Culture:
- Worshipped god in the form of trees, animals -- no temples or religious structures

Technology:
- Implemented advanced irrigation systems to overcome challenging conditions (semi-arid region) utilizing reservoirs (Dholavira) and canals (Shorughai)
- Mastered the potter's wheel, facilitating mass production of standardized pottery
- Constructed granaries (great granary) which aided in storage
- A sophisticated system of weights and measures
- Harappans were among the earliest producers of cotton textiles


The IVC laid the foundation of urbanism in the Indian subcontinent. Deciphering its script remains the final frontier in understanding its society fully.


## Personal Analysis:

Inspired by the grid pattern of IVC, Indian cities like Chandigarh and Jaipur also have adopted grid pattern layout.
