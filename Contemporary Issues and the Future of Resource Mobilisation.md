# Contemporary Issues and the Future of Resource Mobilisation

- Introduction
	- Economic growth can be driven by either investment-led or consumption-led growth, each with distinct characteristics, advantages, and drawbacks.
- Consumption led or Investment led growth: Which one is India pursuing?
	- Investment-Led Growth: 
		- This strategy focuses on increasing investment in capital assets, infrastructure, and industries.
		- It includes private sector investments in machinery and factories, government spending on infrastructure (roads, ports), and household investments in real estate.
		- The benefits include long-term economic capacity building, job creation, and significant multiplier effects. 
		- For instance, ₹100 invested can increase GDP by ₹125 due to the ripple effect of income generation.
		- However, the downside is the high initial costs and long completion times for large projects, which delay returns.
	- Consumption-Led Growth: 
		- Driven by an increase in consumer spending, this model stimulates immediate economic activity, boosts production, and benefits a broader section of the population.
		- However, over-reliance on consumption can lead to sustainability issues, a weaker multiplier effect, and potential inflation risks if demand exceeds supply.
	- The government has sought to catalyse private investment through a significant increase in its own capital expenditure, hoping to "crowd in" private players by creating demand and improving infrastructure.
	- Growth story of India vis-à-vis China
		- In the early 1990s, both countries had similar per capita incomes. 
		- However, by 2023, China's per capita income was five times that of India. 
		- This speedy growth in China was led by investment. 
		- In 1992, investment as a share of GDP was 39% in China compared to 27.4% in India. In 2023, China's investment rate was around 41 % compared to India's 30%.
		- East Asian Tiger economies such as South Korea also underwent a steady shift from consumption-driven to investment-driven growth during their high-growth phases, with a significant decline in the consumption share of GDP and a corresponding doubling of the investment share.
- Role of India’s Capital market in Resource mobilisation for investments
	- An economy's ability to translate savings into productive investment is critical for growth. 
	- In this context, deep and efficient capital markets are indispensable.
	- Current State of India's Capital Market:
		- Equity Market Growth: 
			- India's equity market has shown significant growth and resilience
			- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">market capitalization to GDP ratio stood at a robust 136% </mark>at the end of December 2024, which is significantly higher than that of other major economies like China (65%).
			- This indicates a relatively deep and developed equity market.
		- The Underdeveloped Corporate Bond Market: 
			- A significant weakness in India's financial architecture is its shallow corporate debt market.
			- India’s debt market is dominated by government securities, with a relatively shallow and illiquid corporate bond market compared to advanced economies.
			- According to the Economic Survey 2024-25,<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> India's corporate bond market as a percentage of GDP is only around 18%</mark>, starkly lower than in countries like South Korea (80%)
			- This forces the manufacturing and non- energy infrastructure sectors to rely more on bank credit, hindering long- term capital formation.
		- Investor Base: 
			- There has been a positive trend of growing domestic retail participation, especially in equities and mutual funds, facilitated by digital platforms.
- Challenges faced by NBFCs
	- NBFCs are an indispensable part of India's resource mobilization framework due to their reach and specialized lending. 
	- However, they face the following key issues:
		- The NBFC sector has faced significant stress in the past due to liquidity crunches and asset-liability management (ALM) issues, as highlighted by the IL&FS crisis.
		- Following past crises, the RBI has tightened its regulatory framework for NBFCs, introducing Scale Based Regulation (SBR) to align rules with the systemic risk posed by larger players
		- The IMF has also flagged risks from the high concentration of NBFC lending to the power and infrastructure sectors.
