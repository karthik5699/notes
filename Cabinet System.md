1. The growth of cabinet system has practically resulted in the marginalisation of the parliamentary supremacy. Elucidate.

# Cabinet System

- Introduction
	- The cabinet system is the core of the Indian parliamentary government. 
	- It's a small, powerful body of senior ministers, led by the **Prime Minister**, which directs the government and is collectively responsible to the Parliament.
	- The consolidation of cabinet power has led to the marginalisation of parliament.
- How the Cabinet marginalised parliament
	- Control over Legislation
		- The executive initiates most bills and sets the parliamentary agenda.
		- Party whip ensures that MPs do not vote against the party line. 
		- This means Cabinet decisions sail through Parliament almost automatically
		- Anti-defection law (Tenth Schedule) has further curbed dissent within Parliament, reinforcing executive dominance
	- Bypassing Parliamentary process
		- There is a rising trend of using delegated legislation, where Parliament passes a skeletal law and the executive frames the detailed rules.
		- Further, the frequent use of Ordinances (Article 123) allow the government to legislate without immediate parliamentary scrutiny.
- Parliament's Enduring Relevance
	- Despite this dominance, Parliament retains crucial functions.
	- It remains the nation's highest forum for debate and accountability through instruments like:
		- Question Hour and Zero Hour which hold ministers accountable
		- Adjournment motions to discuss urgent public matters
		- Parliamentary Committees (like Public Accounts Committee) that provide detailed, non-partisan scrutiny of government actions
		- The ultimate power to oust a government via a no-confidence motion.
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, while the cabinet's primacy in policy and law-making is undeniable, Parliament's role as the watchdog of the executive and the voice of the people remains indispensable
	- Strengthening the committee system and ensuring more deliberative sessions are vital to restoring the constitutional equilibrium.
