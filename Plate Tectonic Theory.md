## Questions:

1. Define mantle plume and explain its role in plate tectonics.

# Plate Tectonic Theory

Plate tectonics is a comprehensive theory that integrates seafloor spreading, continental drift, and seismic/volcanic activity.

- The Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates (also called lithospheric plates), which are massive, irregularly shaped slabs of solid rock comprising both continental and oceanic lithosphere
- The lithosphere includes the crust and the top part of the mantle
- These tectonic plates float on and travel independently over the asthenosphere, which lies over the mantle. 
- It is the plates, not just the continents, that move.
- Earth’s lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates
	- Major plates - Antarctica, North American Plate, South American Plate, Pacific plate, India-Australia-New Zealand plate, African plate and Eurasian plate
	- Minor plates - Cocos, Nazca, Arabian, Philippine, Caroline, Fuji
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Much of the earth's seismic activities occur at the boundaries of these plates</mark>. It is a relatively slow movement, driven by thermal convection currents and other geological activities originating deep within the earth's mantle.

Movement of the Indian Plate
- The Indian plate, which includes Peninsular India and parts of Australia, began its northward journey about 200 million years ago
- About 40-50 million years ago, the Indian plate collided with the Asian continent, leading to the rapid uplift of the Himalayas. This process is ongoing, and the Himalayas are still rising.
- The subduction zone along the Himalayas forms the northern plate boundary in the form of continent— continent convergence.
- During its northward movement, around 60 million years ago, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion Hotspot, causing massive outpouring of lava and the formation of the Deccan Traps (presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau)

Types of Plate Boundaries
- Plate boundaries are very important and significant structural features. 
- Nearly all seismic, volcanic and tectonic activities are confined to the plate margins.
- Plates are moving continuously and have relative direction of movement. 
- Based on the direction of movement three types of plate boundaries can be identified
	- Divergent Boundaries: 
		- Where new crust is generated as plates pull away from each other. These are also called spreading sites, with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge being a prime example
		- Divergence (divergent boundary) is responsible for the evolution and creation of new seas and oceans just like convergent boundaries are responsible for the formation of fold mountains, volcanic arcs.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250624215824.png]]
			- Stage 1: Upwarping, fault zones (Look at the image below)
				- Rising limbs of the convection currents create a **plume** that tries to escape to the surface by upwarping the lithosphere (doming the lithosphere upwards).
				- During upwarping, a series of faults are created and the divergence of plates begin.
			- Stage 2: Rift Valley Formation
				- Faulting due to divergence creates extensive rift system
				- The lithosphere is subject to a horizontal extensional force, and it will stretch, becoming thinner
				- Eventually, it will rupture, leading to the formation of a rift valley
				- This process is accompanied by surface manifestations along the rift valley in the form of volcanism and seismic activity.
				- Rifts are the initial stage of a continental break-up and, if successful, can lead to the formation of a new ocean basin
				- Rifting is followed by **flood basalt volcanism** in some places that spread around the rift creating plateaus and highlands
			- Stage 3: Formation of Linear Sea or Rift Lakes
				- Rift valley deepens due to further divergence and makes way for ocean waters
				- If the rift valleys are formed deeper within the continents, rains waters accumulate forming rift lakes
				- Rift lakes form some of the largest freshwater lakes on earth.
				- Successive volcanism and seafloor spreading create spreading sites where new crust is formed
				- Oceanic crust starts to replace continental crust. This stage is the formation of linear seas. Example: Red Sea
			- Stage 4: Linear Sea transforms into Ocean
				- The intense outpouring of basaltic magma accentuates **see floor spreading** and **oceanic crust formation**.
				- Oceanic crust replaces the continental crust, and a mighty ocean is formed.
				- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Crust formation along the mid-oceanic ridge (divergent boundary) is compensated by crust destruction (crustal shortening) along the convergent boundary (destructive Edge). This is how the continents and oceans get transformed.</mark>
	- Convergent Boundaries: 
		- Where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another (subduction zone). Convergence can occur between oceanic and continental plates, two oceanic plates, or two continental plates
			- Ocean-Ocean Convergence
				- ![[Pasted image 20250624205706.png]]
				- The concept of Ocean-Ocean Convergence helps us understand the formation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Japanese Island Arc, Indonesian Archipelago, Philippine Island Arc and Caribbean Islands</mark>
				- In all types of convergence, the denser plate subducts, and the less dense plate is either up thrust or folded or both (upthrust and folded).
				- In Ocean-Ocean Convergence, a **denser oceanic plate** subducts below a **less dense oceanic plate** forming a **trench** along the boundary.
				- As the ocean plate loaded with sediments subducts into the softer asthenosphere, the rocks in the subduction zone become metamorphosed (alteration of the composition or structure of a rock) under high pressure and temperature
				- After reaching a depth of about 100 km, the plates melt. Magma (the melted part of the subducting plate) has lower density and is at high pressure.
				- It rises upwards due to the **buoyant force** offered by surrounding denser medium
				- The magma flows out to the surface. A continuous upward movement of magma creates constant volcanic eruptions at the ocean floor.
				- Constant volcanism above the subduction zone creates layers of rocks. As this process continues for millions of years, a volcanic landform is created which in some cases rises above the ocean waters
				- Such volcanic landforms all along the boundary form a **chain of volcanic islands** which are collectively called as **Island Arcs** (Indonesian Island Arc or Indonesian Archipelago, Philippine Island Arc, Japanese Island Arc etc.)
			- Continent-Ocean Convergence
				- The concept of Continent-Ocean Convergence is important to understand the formation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the Rockies, the Andes and other similar fold mountain systems</mark>
				- Continent-Ocean Convergence is also called **Cordilleran Convergence** because this kind of convergence gives rise to extensive mountain systems.
				- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Continent-Ocean Convergence is similar to ocean-ocean convergence. One important difference is that in continent-ocean convergence mountains are formed instead of islands</mark>
				- When oceanic and continental plates converge, the oceanic plate (denser plate) subducts below the continental plate (less dense plate) forming a **trench** along the boundary.
				- The trenches formed here are not as deep as those formed in ocean-ocean convergence
				- As the ocean floor crust (oceanic plate) loaded with sediments subducts into the softer asthenosphere, the rocks on the continental side in the subduction zone become **metamorphosed** under high pressure and temperature
				- After reaching a certain depth, plates melt. Magma (the melted part of the subducting plate) has lower density and is at high pressure
				- It rises due to the **buoyant force** offered by surrounding denser medium. The magma flows out, sometimes violently to the surface
				- A continuous upward movement of magma creates constant volcanic eruptions at the surface of the continental plate along the margin
				- Such volcanic eruptions all along the boundary form a chain of volcanic mountains which are collectively called as a **continental arc**.
			- Continent-Continent Convergence
				- Understanding Continent-Continent Convergence is important to understand the Formation of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the Himalayas, the Alps, the Urals and the Atlas Mountains</mark>
				- In Continent-Continent Convergence, at continent-continent convergent margins, due to **lower density**, both of the continental crustal plates are too light (buoyant) to be carried downward (subduct) into a trench
				- In most cases, neither plate subducts or even if one of the plates subducts, the subduction zone will not go deeper than 40 – 50 km. The two plates converge, buckle up (suture zone), fold, and fault.
				- As the continental plates converge, the ocean basic or a sedimentary basin (geosynclinal sediments found along the continental margins) is squeezed between the two converging plates.
				- Huge slivers of rock, many kilometres wide are thrust on top of one another, forming a towering mountain range.
				- Examples: The Himalayas, Alps, Urals, Appalachians and the Atlas Mountains
				- Suture Zone
					- When two continents crash into each other, the continental crust is too thick and light (buoyant) to be pushed deep into the Earth (not more than 40 km).
					- So instead of sinking, the pieces of ocean floor that were in between the continents get stuck or squished between them.
					- These leftover bits of oceanic crust get pressed and "welded" together where the two continents meet — this line of joining is called a suture zone, like a scar where they’ve been stitched together.
					- Example: The Indus-Tsangpo Suture Zone is where India collided with Eurasia, and the remains of the Tethys Sea were trapped in between.
				- Formation of the Himalayas
					- The Himalayas are the youngest mountain chain in the world
					- Himalayan mountains have come out of a great geosyncline called the Tethys Sea
					- An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone from this ancient ocean
	- Transform Boundaries: 
		- Where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as plates slide horizontally past each other. Transform faults are generally perpendicular to mid-oceanic ridges
		- Eg: San Andreas Fault
- Limitations of plate tectonic theory:
	- The theory of plate tectonics explains the movement of plates, largely attributing it to mantle convection. 
	- However, this explanation does not fully account for phenomena like [[Hotspot Volcanism]] caused due to mantle plumes—rising hot rocks.

1. Oceanic crust = thin, heavy, young, from lava
2. Continental crust = thick, light, old, made of many rock types

Ocean crust is made of basalt (Iron and Magnesium) which is why it is denser than the Continental crust made up of Granite (Silica & Aluminium)
