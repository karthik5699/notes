# Making of the Indian Constitution

- Introduction
	- The Constitution was framed between 1946 and 1950 by the **Constituent Assembly**
- Influences and Legacies:
	- Indigenous Traditions: 
		- India also had a long history of governance, with examples like the Mauryan Empire's codified laws (Kautilya's Arthashastra) and the local self-governance of the Gupta Period, which influenced ideas like Panchayati Raj and welfare-oriented state policies (Directive Principles)
	- **Colonial Rule:** 
		- British colonial administration, through acts like the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935, introduced concepts such as the rule of law, a codified legal system, and electoral mechanisms. 
		- While exploitative, these frameworks influenced the constitutional imagination. 
		- The oppressive nature of colonial laws, such as the Rowlatt Act and Sedition Laws, highlighted the urgent need for a framework guaranteeing **fundamental rights**
	- Nationalist Aspirations: 
		- The freedom struggle articulated a demand for a self-rule model that was just, inclusive, and representative. 
		- Early constitutional demands, like the Nehru Report (1928) for a Bill of Rights and the Karachi Resolution (1931) for socio-economic rights, were integrated into the Constitution. 
		- The trauma of Partition reinforced the commitment to secularism and national unity
- Key Architects and Their Visions:
	- **B.R. Ambedkar:** 
		- As the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Ambedkar viewed the Constitution as an instrument for **social transformation**, particularly to dismantle India's hierarchical and exclusionary caste system
		- He ensured the inclusion of universal adult suffrage, parliamentary government, independent institutions, and robust provisions for social justice
		- He notably advanced the concept of **constitutional morality** as an ethical framework for governance
	- Jawaharlal Nehru: 
		- Deeply influenced by democratic socialism and modernist rationalism, Nehru envisioned a modern, industrial, and secular democratic state
	- **Mahatma Gandhi:** 
		- While his ideal of decentralized village republics ("Gram Swaraj") did not directly shape the Constitution's initial parliamentary structure, his emphasis on grassroots democracy influenced the **Directive Principles** (Article 40) and the eventual **73rd and 74th Amendments** institutionalizing Panchayati Raj
