# Earth's Magnetic Field

Dynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the Coriolis effect (caused due to the rotation of the earth), gives rise to self-sustaining Earth‚Äôs magnetic field.

The Earth acts like a giant bar magnet with invisible magnetic lines stretching from the South Pole to the North Pole. The magnetic field forms a bubble around Earth called the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">magnetosphere</mark>. It extends thousands of kms into space.

üõ°Ô∏è **Why Is It Important?**
- Shields us from solar wind
- Navigation
- Clues to Earth's interior

- #### Geomagnetic Poles
	- The Geomagnetic poles (dipole poles) are the intersections of the Earth‚Äôs surface and the axis of a bar magnet hypothetically placed at the centre the Earth.

	- Approximately, geomagnetic dipole is currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees to Earth‚Äôs rotational axis. (<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Magnetic Declination</mark>)
	- The difference in the position of magnetic poles and geomagnetic poles is due to the uneven and complex distribution of the earth‚Äôs magnetic field.
	- If a magnetic compass needle is suspended freely at the magnetic poles then it will point straight down at the north magnetic pole (south pole of earth‚Äôs magnetic field) and straight up at the south magnetic pole (north pole of earth‚Äôs magnetic field).
	- A geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet‚Äôs magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged.
	- Based on <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">palaeomagnetism</mark> (magnetism in rocks that was induced by the earth‚Äôs magnetic field at the time of their formation), it is observed that over the last 20 million years, magnetic north and south have flipped roughly every 200,000 to 300,000 years




## Personal Analysis:

Earth‚Äôs ‚ÄúMagnetic North Pole‚Äù is actually a magnetic south pole in physical terms, because it attracts the north end of your compass.

Various organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria, sea turtles, some migratory birds, pigeons, etc. use the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field for orientation and navigation
