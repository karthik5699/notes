1. Examine how the decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India crippled the rural economy

# Decline of traditional artisanal industry in colonial India

#### Deindustrialisation and Ruin of Artisans:
- Introduction of cheap, machine-made British imports into the Indian market, facilitated by the Charter Act of 1813 allowing one-way free trade, flooded India with foreign goods
- Simultaneously, high tariffs (nearly 80%) were imposed on Indian textiles to make them uncompetitive, effectively closing European markets to Indian exports
	- This deliberate policy was aimed at promoting British manufacturers at the expense of Indian industries
- Indian artisans and handicraftsmen suffered immensely from the loss of their traditional patrons—native rulers and nobles—who could not now afford to be patrons of the crafts workers
- The once-flourishing Indian textile industry was steadily destroyed

#### Ruralisation and Increased Pressure on Land:
- The destruction of indigenous industries was not accompanied by the development of modern industries in India, unlike in rapidly industrializing European countries
- This led to a process of "ruralisation", where many artisans abandoned their professions and moved to villages to take up agriculture
- This mass migration of displaced workers increased the pressure on already burdened agricultural land, leading to overpopulation in the rural sector

#### Impoverishment of the Peasantry and Breakdown of Village Economy:
- The increased pressure on land, combined with colonial land revenue settlements, heavy taxes, and arbitrary evictions, meant the peasantry suffered greatly
- The government was primarily interested in maximizing revenue, often imposing exorbitant land revenues
- Zamindars, with increased powers, resorted to summary evictions, illegal dues, and forced labor ("begar") to maximize profits, without incentive to improve agriculture
- Peasants were often forced to borrow from moneylenders at usurious rates, leading to indebtedness and eventual loss of land
- This "triple burden" of the government, zamindars, and moneylenders, along with famines and natural calamities, led to the impoverishment of the peasantry and a general decline in the village economic set-up
- Forced commercialisation of Agriculture
	- To pay high taxes, farmers were forced to shift from food crops to cash crops (indigo, cotton) which increased their vulnerability to famines

In essence, the British colonial policies systematically destroyed India's traditional manufacturing base without fostering modern industrialization, forcing a large population to rely solely on an increasingly exploited and overburdened agricultural sector, thus crippling the rural economy.
