# Adiabatic Lapse Rate

Condensation of water vapour, thunderstorms, cyclonic and anticyclonic conditions etc. depend on Adiabatic Lapse Rate. Adiabatic Lapse Rate determines the Rate of Condensation and the rate of condensation determines the amount of Latent Heat of Condensation released.

Lapse Rate
- Lapse rate is rate of change in temperature observed while moving upward through the Earth’s atmosphere
- The lapse rate is considered **positive** when the temperature decreases with elevation, **zero** when the temperature is constant with elevation, and **negative** when the temperature increases with elevation **(temperature inversion)**
- The lapse rate of non-rising air – commonly referred to as the normal, or <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Environmental, Lapse Rate (ELR)</mark> – is highly variable, being affected by radiation, convection, and condensation; it averages about 5 °C per kilometer in the lower atmosphere

Why does temperature fall with elevation
- With increase in elevation, the **atmospheric pressure falls**. Fall in pressure implies that the temperature also falls (Pressure is directly proportional to Temperature)
- With increase in elevation, the concentration of greenhouse gases decrease (Water vapor and carbon dioxide fall sharply with elevation). Hence the heat absorption capacity of atmosphere will also decrease

Adiabatic Lapse rate
- Lapse rate is the rate of fall in temperature of atmosphere with elevation
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Adiabatic Lapse Rate is the rate of fall in temperature of a rising or a falling air parcel adiabatically</mark>.
- Adiabatic or adiabatically: Heat doesn’t enter or leave the system. All temperature changes are internal.
- Adiabatic Lapse rate is governed by Gas law.
	- According to gas law Pressure ‘P’ is directly proportional to Temperature ‘T’ when Volume ‘V’ is a constant.

Adiabatic Process: A Parcel of Rising or Falling Air
- A parcel of air rises when it is less denser than the surrounding environment and it falls when its density becomes greater than the surrounding environment
- A Parcel of Rising Air
	- When an air parcel is subjected to differential heating compared to the surrounding air, it becomes lighter (less denser) or heavier (more denser) depending on whether the air parcel is heated or cooled
	- When an air parcel receives more heat than the surrounding air, its temperature increases leading to an increase in volume (Increase in Volume == Fall in Density). 
		- The air parcel becomes lighter than the surrounding air and it starts to rise. 
		- This process is non-adiabatic (there is heat exchange between the air parcel and the external environment).
	- But when the air parcel starts to rise, the ambient pressure on it starts to fall ( atmospheric pressure decreases with height, so the pressure on the air parcel decreases with height). 
		- With the fall in ambient pressure, the temperature falls and the volume increases.
		- This is adiabatic (there is no heat exchange between the air parcel and the external environment. All the temperature changes are internal. Temperature changes are only due to change in pressure or volume or both).
	- This fall in temperature with the rising of the air parcel is called Adiabatic Temperature Lapse. And the rate at which it happens is called Adiabatic Lapse Rate
	- *<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Rising of a parcel of air (and associated Positive Adiabatic Lapse Rate) is the first step in the formation of Thunderstorms, Tornadoes and Cyclones.</mark>*
- A Parcel of Falling Air
	- An air parcels falls to the lower levels of troposphere when it is cooled sufficiently
	- When an air parcel is in the upper levels, it gets cooled due to lower temperatures (Lapse Rate). 
		- It’s volume falls and it’s density increases. 
		- When it becomes more denser than the surroundings, it starts to fall.
	- This also happens when an air parcel is in contact with cooler surfaces like mountain slopes
	- The beginning of fall is a non-adiabatic process as there is an exchange of heat between the air parcel and the surrounding environment
	- When an air parcel is falling, the atmospheric pressure acting on it will increase and its internal temperature will increase adiabatically. 
		- This is Negative Adiabatic Lapse Rate as the Temperature is rising.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Katabatic Wind</mark> is a hot dry wind that blows down a mountain slope. It is an example for a falling parcel of air in which the temperature changes happen adiabatically.

Adiabatic Lapse Rate in simple terms
- Adiabatic change refers to the change in temperature with pressure.
- On descent through atmosphere, the lower layers are compressed under atmospheric pressure. As a result, the temperature increases.
- On ascent, the air expands as pressure ‘decreases’. This expansion reduces the temperature and aids condensation of water vapour. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Condensation of water vapour releases the Latent Heat of Condensation in the process</mark>.
- This latent heat of condensation is the major driving force behind tropical cyclones, convectional rains

Wet and Dry Adiabatic Lapse rate
- Adiabatic lapse rates are usually differentiated as dry or wet (moist).
- Dry Adiabatic Lapse rate
	- The Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate (DALR) is the rate of fall in temperature with altitude for a parcel of dry or unsaturated air (air with less moisture, to keep it simple) rising under adiabatic conditions
	- Unsaturated air has less than 100% relative humidity
	- When a rising air parcel has little moisture, condensation during upliftment is low, the latent heat of condensation released is low (Less additional heat from inside). 
	- As a result, the fall in temperature with height is greater compared to Adiabatic Lapse Rate (normal parcel of air)
		- Less moisture → less condensation → less heat inside → faster cooling with height
	- The dry adiabatic lapse rate for the Earth’s atmosphere equals 8° C per kilometre
	- Dry Adiabatic Lapse rate is mainly associated with stable conditions
- Wet Adiabatic Lapse rate
	- When an air parcel that is saturated with water vapour rises, some of the vapour will condense and release latent heat (Additional Heat from inside). 
	- This process causes the parcel to cool more slowly than it would if it were not saturated
	- The greater the amount of vapour, the smaller the adiabatic lapse rate (because the condensation process keeps on adding more latent heat of condensation). 
	- On an average it is taken as 4° C per kilometre.
	- Wet Adiabatic Lapse rate is mainly associated with unstable conditions
- Significance in meteorology
	- The difference between the normal lapse rate in the atmosphere and the dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates determines the vertical stability of the atmosphere.
	- For this reason, the lapse rate is of prime importance to meteorologists in forecasting certain types of cloud formations, the incidence of thunderstorms, and the intensity of atmospheric turbulence

Weather conditions at different adiabatic lapse rates
- LR (Lapse Rate) = Average Adiabatic Lapse Rate of entire atmosphere = 6 °C/km (ALR of a place may be greater than or lesser than the Laspe Rate of atmosphere, i.e, it may be less than or greater than 6 °C/km)
- If ALR at a place is greater than 6 °C/km then it is called DALR = Less moisture than normal = more stable than normal.
- If ALR at a place is lesser than 6 °C/km then it is  called WALR = More moisture than normal = less stable than normal or instability.
- Absolute stability: ALR (at a place) > DALR == Little moisture in the air parcel == It won’t rain
- Conditional stability: WALR < ALR < DALR == Normal moisture conditions == It may or may not rain
- Absolute instability: ALR (at a place) < WALR == Excess moisture in the air parcel == It will rain violently.

#### Latent Heat of Condensation
- Latent heat of condensation is the driving force behind all tropical cyclones
- Latent Heat
	- It is the heat released or absorbed during phase change.
	- Amount of energy absorbed or released by a substance during a change in its physical state that occurs without changing its temperature
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705121536.png]]
	- For example, when a pot of water is kept boiling, the temperature remains at 100 °C until the last drop evaporates, because all the heat being added to the liquid is absorbed as latent heat of vaporization and carried away by the escaping vapour molecules.
	- From the above graph, we can observe that there is no change in temperature in the system during change of state or phase change (solid to liquid, liquid to solid, liquid to gas and gas to liquid). Then where did the heat supplied go?
	- Initially the heat supplied is used to raise the temperature of the system (A – B & C – D)
	- During phase change, the heat supplied is consumed to turn water into liquid and then liquid into gas. So the heat supplied is used in phase change. Hence temperature of the system remains constant during phase change process. (B – C & D – E)
	- But when gas turns into liquid or liquid into solid, heat is released. (this heat is the heat that was used during the phase change process)
	- So latent heat of condensation is the heat released when gases turn into liquid.
