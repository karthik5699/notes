# Himalayan Ranges

![[Pasted image 20250725162009.png]]

- Major Physical Divisions of India
	- The Himalayas
		- Includes the Himalayas, Purvanchal and their extensions Arakan Yoma (Myanmar) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (but we will consider these as islands only)
		- It is the youngest and highly unstable landmass of India.
		- Tectonic movements are very common.
	- Indo-Gangetic Plain
		- Between Peninsular and Himalayan region
		- Most youthful, monotonous region prone to tectonic forces.
	- The Peninsular Plateau
		- Includes the entire south India, central India, Aravallis, Rajmahal hills, Meghalaya plateau, Kuchchh-Kathiawar region (Gujarat) etc
		- It is the oldest and the most stable landmass of India
	- Coastal Plains
		- Eastern Coastal Plains and Western Coastal Plains
		- Formed due to consolidation of sediments brought by rivers (fluvial deposits)
		- Highly **stable** just like peninsular plateau
	- The Indian Islands
		- Two major groups – Lakshadweep and, Andaman and Nicobar islands.
		- Lakshadweep (Hotspot) are group of atolls occupied by coral reefs. No significant volcanism or tectonic activity in recent past. Highly vulnerable to sea-level rise
		- Andaman and Nicobar islands – Continuation of Arakan Yoma. Has active volcanoes and is tectonically active.

- Division of the Himalayas
	- Himalayan Ranges
		- Series of several parallel or converging ranges
		- The ranges are separated by deep valleys creating a highly dissected topography
		- The southern slopes have steep gradients and northern slopes have comparatively gentler slopes. 
			- Scaling Mount Everest is less hectic from the northern side. 
			- But China puts restrictions so climbers take the steeper southern slopes from Nepal
		- Most of the Himalayan ranges fall in India, Nepal and Bhutan. 
		- The northern slopes are partly situated in Tibet (trans-Himalayas) while the western extremity lies in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia.
		- Himalayas between Tibet and Ganga Plain is a succession of three parallel ranges
			- Shiwalik Range
				- Also known as Outer Himalayas.
				- The altitude varies from 600 to 1500 metres
				- Runs for a distance of 2,400 km from the Potwar Plateau to the Brahmaputra valley
				- The southern slopes are steep while the northern slopes are gentle
				- The width of the Shiwaliks varies from 50 km in Himachal Pradesh to less than 15 km in Arunachal Pradesh
				- They are almost unbroken chain of low hills except for a gap of 80-90 km which is occupied by the valley of the **Tista River and Raidak River**
				- Valleys are part of synclines and hills are part of anticlines
					- ![[Pasted image 20250725164112.png]]
				- Shiwaliks were formed last of all the ranges
				- The Shiwaliks are consolidated sands, gravels and conglomerate deposits (Alluvial fans) which were brought by the rivers flowing from the higher ranges
				- Explain the formation of Duns
					- Shiwalik Hills were formed by the accumulation of conglomerates (sand, stone, silt, gravel, debris etc.)
					- These conglomerates, in the initial stages of deposition, obstructed the courses of the rivers draining from the higher reaches of the Himalayas and formed temporary lakes
					- With passage of time, these temporary lakes accumulated more and more conglomerates. The conglomerates were well settled at the bottom of the lakes
					- When the rivers were able to cut their courses through the lakes filled with conglomerate deposits, the lakes were drained away leaving behind plains called ‘duns’ or ‘doons’ in the west and ‘duars’ in the east.
					- Dehra Dun in Uttarakhand is the best example 
					- Kotah, Patli Kothri, Chumbi, Kyarda, Chaukhamba, Udhampur and Kotli are other important duns.
			- Middle or the Lesser Himalaya
				- In between the Shiwaliks in the south and the Greater Himalayas in the north
				- It is also called the Himachal or Lower Himalaya
				- Elevations vary from 3,500 to 4,500 m above sea level
				- Many peaks are more than 5,000 m above sea level and are snow covered throughout the year
				- In Uttarakhand, the Middle Himalayas are marked by the Mussoorie and the Nag Tibba ranges
					- The **Mahabharat Lekh**, in southern Nepal is a continuation of the Mussoorie Range
				- The Middle Himalayan ranges are more friendly to human contact
				- Majority of the Himalayan hill resorts like Shimla, Mussoorie, Ranikhet, Nainital, Almora and Darjeeling, etc. are located here.
				- The Pir Panjal range
					- ![[Pasted image 20250725181712.png]]
					- The Pir Panjal range in Kashmir is the longest and the most important range
					- It extends from the Jhelum river to the upper Beas river
					- Passes in Pir Panjal
						- Pir Panjal Pass, the Bidil, Golabghar Pass and Banihal Pass
						- The Banihal Pass is used by the Jammu-Srinagar highway and Jammu-Baramula railway
						- The Kishanganga, the Jhelum and the Chenab cut through the range.
						- Southeast of the Ravi, the Pir Panjal continues as Dhaola Dhar range, passing through Dalhousie, Dharmshala, and Shimla
					- Important Valleys
						- Between the Pir Panjal and the Zaskar Range of the main Himalayas, lies the valley of Kashmir
							- The Kashmir valley is made of layered sediments from rivers (fluvial), lakes (lacustrine), glaciers, and alluvial deposits.
							- Jhelum River meanders through these deposits and cuts a deep gorge in Pir Panjal through which it drains.
						- In Himachal Pradesh there is Kangra Valley.
						- On the other hand, there is Kulu Valley in the upper course of the Ravi
			- The Great Himalaya
				- Also known as Inner Himalaya, Central Himalaya or Himadri.
				- Average elevation of 6,100 m above sea level and an average width of about 25 km
				- The folds in this range are asymmetrical with steep south slope and gentle north slope
				- Terminates abruptly at the syntaxial bends. One in the Nanga Parbat in north-west and the other in the Namcha Barwa in the north-east
				- This mountain range boasts of the tallest peaks of the world, most of which remain under perpetual snow.
				- Passes in the Greater Himalayas
					- ![[Pasted image 20250725172620.png]]
		- The Trans Himalayas
			- ![[Pasted image 20250725163205.png]]
			- The Himalayan ranges immediately north of the Great Himalayan range
			- Also called the Tibetan Himalaya because most of it lies in Tibet
			- The Zaskar, the Ladakh, the Kailas and the Karakoram are the main ranges
			- It stretches for a distance of about 1,000 km in east-west direction
			- Average elevation is 3000 m above mean sea level.
			- Some of the peaks are more than 8,000 metre above sea level. K2 (8,611 m)
			- The Nanga Parbat (8126 m) is an important range which is in The Zaskar Range
			- River Indus originates from the northern slopes of the Kailas range. 
			- The northern most range of the Trans-Himalayan Ranges in India is the Great Karakoram Range also known as the Krishnagiri range.
				- It is the abode of some of the greatest glaciers of the world outside the polar regions.
		- Purvanchal or Eastern Hills
			- ![[Pasted image 20250725173404.png]]
			- Eastern Hills or The Purvanchal are the southward extension of Himalayas running along the north-eastern edge of India
			- At the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas take a sudden southward bend and form a series of comparatively low hills which are collectively called as the Purvanchal
			- They run along the India-Myanmar Border extending from Arunachal Pradesh in the north to Mizoram in the south.
			- Patkai Bum hills are made up of strong sandstone; elevation varying from 2,000 m to 3,000 m; merges into Naga Hills where Saramati (3,826 m) is the highest peak
			- Patkai Bum and Naga Hills form the watershed (a natural divide) between India and Myanmar.
			- South of Naga Hills are the Manipur hills which are generally less than 2,500 metres in elevation
			- South of the Manipur Hills are the Mizo Hills (previously known as the Lushai hills) which have an elevation of less than 1,500 metres. 
				- The highest point is the Blue Mountain (2,157 m) in the south.
