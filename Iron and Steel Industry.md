## Questions:

1. Account for the present location of iron and steel industries away from the source of raw material, by giving examples.
2. Account for the change in the spatial pattern of the Iron and Steel industry in the world.

# Iron and Steel Industry

![[Pasted image 20250915134345.png]]

- Introduction
	- The Indian iron and steel industry stands as a global powerhouse, ranking as the world's second- largest producer of crude steel.
	- The iron and steel industry is a crucial sector in India’s economy with significant contributions to GDP, employment, and industrial growth
	- The steel sector contributes about 2% to India’s GDP and has a strong multiplier effect.
- Locational Factors of Iron and Steel Industry
	- Primary Factor: 
		- Raw material proximity → Proximity to iron ore, coal, limestone
			- Key for minimizing transport costs. 
			- Example: Bhilai plant near iron ore mines
	- Secondary Factors:
		- Market access → Reduced finished product transport costs → Competitiveness. 
			- Example: 
				- Tata Steel's scrap-based plant in Rohtak (near auto industry)
				- Plants like Salem and Bhilai serve the automobile and engineering industry
		- Port access → Easy import/export → Global competitiveness. 
			- Example: Vizag Steel Plant near Vizag port
		- Government policies → Strategic plant locations → Balanced regional growth
- Distribution in the world

- Major regions in India:
	- Chotanagpur Plateau: 
		- Jamshedpur (TISCO), Bokaro, Durgapur, Rourkela, Bhilai.
	- Southern India: 
		- Vijayanagar (Karnataka), Salem (TN), Vishakhapatnam
	- Western Coast
		- Ratnagiri, New Mangalore
- Challenges Confronting the Industry
	- Raw material dependence → Imported coking coal → Higher production costs 
		- India imports 85% of coking coal due to limited domestic reserves 
		- Imported coal has lower ash content ~10% vs. domestic ~25-30%, crucial for quality steel.
	- Infrastructure bottlenecks → Inefficient logistics → Increased operational costs 
		- E.g., congested railways, inadequate port facilities 
		- Average logistics cost in India: 14% of GDP vs global average of 8%
	- Regulatory hurdles → Project delays → Reduced competitiveness 
		- Multiple clearances needed for mining: environmental, forest, land acquisition
		- Average time for clearances: 2-3 years
	- Global competition (China) → Price pressure → Profit margin squeeze 
		- China produces 50% of world's steel 
		- Indian steel often 15-20% costlier than Chinese imports
	- Environmental concerns
		- Steel sector accounts for about 12% of India’s carbon dioxide emissions and is the largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector.
- Government Initiatives: Boosting the Steel Sector
	- National Steel Policy 2017 and Make in India initiative to boost production and self-reliance.
	- Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for specialty steel.
	- Mission Purvodaya to promote steel production in eastern India.
- Way Forward
	- Green Steel
		- Manufacturing of steel using renewable or low-carbon energy sources such as hydrogen, coal gasification
- Conclusion
	- The iron and steel industry is the spine of India’s industrialization
