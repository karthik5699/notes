## Questions:

1. Discuss the causes of depletion of mangroves and explain their importance in maintaining coastal ecology.

# Depletion of Mangroves

- Introduction
	- Mangroves are specialized plants that thrive where land and sea mingle — salty, waterlogged soils along tropical and subtropical coasts.
	- Their very existence depends on a delicate balance: tidal flow, salinity, sediment supply, and space
- Causes of depletion of mangroves
	- **Coastal development**: 
		- Ports, resorts, aquaculture ponds (especially shrimp farming), and urban expansion clear mangroves to make way for “profitable” use of land.
	- **Agriculture**: 
		- Conversion of mangrove areas into paddy fields or coconut plantations is common in South and Southeast Asia.
	- **Dams and embankments** reduce freshwater flow and sediment supply, making soils too saline or starved of nutrients for mangroves
	- **Industrial effluents and oil spills** poison roots and seedlings.
	- **Fuelwood, charcoal, and timber collection** directly remove trees
	- **Sea-level rise** can drown mangroves if landward migration is blocked by human settlements.
- Importance of mangroves in maintaining coastal ecology
	- **Natural barriers**: 
		- Their dense root networks break wave energy, protecting coasts from erosion, storm surges, and tsunamis 
		- The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami showed villages shielded by mangroves fared better.
	- **Nurseries of the sea**: 
		- Mangrove creeks are breeding grounds for fish, crabs, shrimp, and mollusks. 
		- Local fishing communities depend on this biodiversity
	- **Carbon sinks**: 
		- Mangroves store “blue carbon” in soils — up to 4–5 times more than terrestrial forests — making them powerful allies against climate change
	- **Water filtration**: 
		- Roots trap sediments, heavy metals, and pollutants, improving water quality and protecting coral reefs and seagrass beds.
- Government Initiatives
	- MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats Tangible Incomes): 
		- A program by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC) aimed at mangrove conservation and livelihood generation.
- Conclusion
	- Their loss isn’t just the disappearance of some “trees by the sea”; it destabilizes entire coastal ecosystems, weakens climate resilience, and erodes human livelihoods.
