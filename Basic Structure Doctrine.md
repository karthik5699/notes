# Basic Structure Doctrine

- Introduction
	- The **Basic Structure Doctrine (BSD)** is a landmark principle in Indian constitutional jurisprudence, asserting that certain fundamental features of the Constitution cannot be abrogated or altered by Parliament, even through constitutional amendment
- Genesis and Core Tenets
	- The doctrine was propounded by the Supreme Court of India in the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case in 1973. 
	- It has set specific limits to the Parliament's power to amend the constitution.
	- It says that no amendment can violate the basic structure of the Constitution
	- It places the judiciary as the final authority in deciding if an amendment violates basic structure and what constitutes basic structure.  
- Key features identified as part of the basic structure:
	- Democracy
	- Rule of Law
	- Separation of powers
	- Federalism
	- Secularism
	- Free and Fair elections
	- The **balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy**
	- Judicial Review
- Judicial Evolution and Role of the Supreme Court
	- Early Phase (1951-1967): 
		- Initially, in cases like Shankari Prasad (1951) and Sajjan Singh (1965), the Supreme Court held that Parliament's power under Article 368 was unlimited, including the power to amend fundamental rights
	- First Resistance (1967): 
		- In Golaknath v. State of Punjab (1967), the Court reversed its earlier rulings, stating that Parliament could not amend fundamental rights and introduced the idea of limited amending power. 
		- This led to a constitutional crisis, with Parliament asserting its supremacy through the 24th Amendment, 1971
	- **Birth of the Doctrine (1973)**: 
		- _Kesavananda Bharati_ established that while Parliament can amend any part of the Constitution, it cannot alter its basic structure
	- Post-Kesavananda Affirmations: 
		- The Court refined the doctrine in subsequent cases, declaring specific features as part of the basic structure. 
		- For instance, in Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975), free and fair elections were declared a basic feature. 
		- In Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980), the Court reinforced the balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles as inviolable and clarified that a limited amending power is itself part of the basic structure. 
		- S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994) affirmed federalism and secularism as basic features
- The Basic Structure Doctrine has profound implications:
	- Redefining Parliamentary Sovereignty: 
		- Unlike the British Parliament, which enjoys unlimited sovereignty, the Indian Parliament operates within a written, supreme Constitution
		- The BSD asserts that Parliament is not a sovereign constituent assembly; instead, the Constitution represents a higher authority, created by the people, making popular sovereignty, not legislative supremacy, the source of constitutional authority
		- Article 368 confers only a limited or derivative power to Parliament, not original constituent power.
	- Judicial Review as Constitutional Guardian: 
		- The judiciary acts as the "sentinel of the Constitution," with the power to review and invalidate amendments that violate the basic structure and to define what constitutes the basic structure
- Democratic Tensions and Criticisms
	- While praised as a bulwark against authoritarianism and majoritarian overreach, the doctrine faces criticisms:
		- Judicial Supremacy: 
			- Critics argue that it grants the judiciary excessive power to override parliamentary will and is undemocratic, as unelected judges nullify amendments passed by elected representatives
		- **Ambiguity**: 
			- The criteria for determining what constitutes the "basic structure" are broad and indeterminate, inviting subjectivity
	- Supporters, however, contend that the judiciary's legitimacy flows from the Constitution itself
- Conclusion
	- The Basic Structure Doctrine continues to be invoked in contemporary debates over various legislative and policy changes, serving as a constitutional guardrail in times of political and institutional stress. 
	- It ensures that India’s democratic identity remains intact even as it adapts to societal demands. 
	- This showcases India’s **innovative constitutionalism**, balancing flexibility with foundational stability.
	- One of the greatest contributions of SC in field of 'constitutional law'
- Opinions
	- Zia Mody
		- Doctrine of Basic Structure may have resulted into uncertain democracy but has saved India from certain tyranny. 
		- It is true that judiciary is not directly accountable to the people of India through elections. 
		- However, constitution recognises SC as the guardian of the constitution
	- Upendra Baxi  
		- Without the basic structure, we end up with constitution without constitutionalism
