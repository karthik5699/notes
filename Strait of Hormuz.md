- The Strait of Hormuz is a channel less than 100 km in width, separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea
- A crucial choke point for the world's oil supply - key passage for oil and natural gas from the littoral nations Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar and Iran to the rest of the world.
- Around a quarter (1/4th) of the world's oil supply passes through this channel.
- India's oil supply is heavily reliant on the region, with around 40% of its crude oil imports and 54% of its liquefied natural gas imports travelling through the Strait of Hormuz
