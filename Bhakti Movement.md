# Bhakti Movement

An important feature of the cultural history of medieval India was the silent revolution in society brought about by the galaxy of socio-religious reformers, a revolution known as the Bhakti movement. Certain factors had necessitated the emergence of Bhaktism. Hinduism had become extremely ritualistic and was ridden by the caste system. Both Buddhism and Jainism preached extreme austerity and suffered from lack of patronage. People were seeking an avenue to satisfy their emotional and spiritual needs. These factors led to the rise and growth of the Bhakti tradition within the fold of Hinduism. 

1. Origin
	- originated in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu between 7th and 12th century
	- slowly percolated to North India by 15th century
	- In South India there were 2 main groups of Bhakti saints
		- Nayanars (Shiva devotees)
		- Alvars (Vishnu devotees)
	- the word 'Bhakti' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'bhaj' which means to share, participate and belong to.

	- using local and regional languages to spread their message
	- they stressed on the idea of a personal God (who can be related to as a person)
