## Questions:

1. India’s deepening groundwater crisis is fast becoming one of the most pressing challenges to its development trajectory. Examine its economic and ecological consequences. What policy shifts are required to ensure sustainable use? (15 M)

# Water Crisis in India

- Introduction
	- India has 18% of the world’s population but only about 4% of the world’s water resources, which creates a significant challenge in managing water availability and demand.
- Issues related to water resources
	- Urbanization and Land Use Change: 
		- Rapid urban growth leads to less land available for water absorption, increasing runoff and flood risks while reducing groundwater recharge.
	- Surface Water Pollution: 
		- Rivers and lakes are polluted by untreated sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural runoff, compromising water quality and ecosystem health
		- Examples: The Ganga and Yamuna rivers are among the most polluted
	- Inefficient Water Use in Agriculture: 
		- Outdated irrigation methods waste significant amounts of water
		- Example: Agriculture consumes about 80–85% of India’s freshwater, but water use efficiency is only 25–35% in conventional irrigation
	- Climate Change and Erratic Monsoons: 
		- Shifting monsoon patterns result in more frequent droughts and unpredictable water availability, disrupting agriculture and water supply.
		- India’s water resources heavily depend on monsoon rains, which are becoming increasingly erratic due to climate change
	- Groundwater Depletion: 
		- Excessive extraction for irrigation and industry is causing groundwater levels to fall rapidly, threatening long-term water security.
