## Questions:

1. Assess the role of British imperial power in complicating the process of transfer of power during the 1940s.

# Transfer of Power & Partition

The 1940s marked a crucial period in India's path to independence, characterized by intensified negotiations, proposals, and political shifts leading to the transfer of power from British rule.

Key initiatives and events during this decade:
- August Offer (1940):
	- Following Hitler's successes in Europe and the fall of key nations, Britain adopted a conciliatory approach
		- Both Gandhi and Nehru strongly opposed the idea of taking advantage of Britain’s position
	- Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy, announced the August Offer which proposed:
		- dominion status as the objective for India
		- expansion of viceroy’s executive council which would have a majority of Indians
		- setting up of a constituent assembly after the war where mainly Indians would decide the constitution
		- No future constitution to be adopted without the consent of minorities
	- The Congress rejected the August Offer
		- Nehru said, “Dominion status concept is dead as a doornail.”
	- The Muslim League welcomed the veto assurance, reiterating that partition was the only solution
- Cripps Mission (1942): 
	- In March 1942, Stafford Cripps was sent to India with constitutional proposals to seek Indian support for the war.
	- Britain faced severe reverses in South-East Asia, making the Japanese threat to India real and Indian support crucial
		- There was also pressure from allies like the USA, USSR, and China to secure Indian cooperation
	- Main Proposals:
		- An Indian Union with a dominion status would be set up; it would be free to decide its relations with the Commonwealth
		- After the end of the war, a constituent assembly would be convened to frame a new constitution. 
			- Members of this assembly would be partly elected by the provincial assemblies through proportional representation and partly nominated by the princes.
			- Provinces unwilling to join the Indian Union could opt out, draft their constitutions, and form independent unions.
		- Defence of India would remain with the British, and the governor-general's powers intact
	- How is it different from August Offer?
		- making of the constitution was to be solely in Indian hands now and not ‘mainly’ 
		- A concrete plan was provided for the constituent assembly
		- Free India could withdraw from the Commonwealth
	- Reasons for Failure
		- The Congress objected to dominion status (rather than full independence), the right of provinces to secede, and the absence of any immediate transfer of power or real share in defence
- Rajagopalachari Formula (1944):
	- Rajagopalachari prepared a formula for Congress-League cooperation, which was a tacit acceptance of the League's demand for Pakistan. Gandhi supported the formula.
	- Features:
		- Muslim League to endorse Congress demand for independence
		- League to cooperate with Congress in forming a provisional government at centre
		- After the end of the war, the entire population of Muslim majority areas in the North-West and North-East India to decide by a plebiscite, whether or not to form a separate sovereign state
		- In case of acceptance of partition, agreement to be made jointly for safeguarding defence, commerce, communications, etc.
- Wavell Plan (1945):
	- Lord Wavell was permitted to negotiate with Indian leaders to find a solution to the constitutional question
	- For this purpose, a conference was convened by the viceroy, Lord Wavell, at Shimla in June 1945
	- Main Proposals:
		- It aimed to reconstruct the governor-general's executive council, with all members except the governor-general and commander-in-chief being Indians
		- Caste Hindus and Muslims were to have equal representation
		- The reconstructed council was to function as an interim government within the framework of the 1935 Act
	- Reasons for failure:
		- Congress objected to being reduced to a "purely caste Hindu party"
		- Muslim League insisted that all Muslim nominees must be from the League
- Cabinet Mission (1946):
	- The Labour government under Clement Attlee decided to send a high-powered mission to India to find a negotiated, peaceful transfer of power
	- Why British Withdrawal Seemed Imminent Now
		- the change in the balance of global power (UK no longer a superpower, USA and USSR favoured India's freedom)
		- The new Labour government was more sympathetic to Indian demands
		- British soldiers were weary and tired and the British economy lay shattered
	- Main Proposals:
		- The Mission rejected the idea of Pakistan
		- It proposed a three-tier confederation for a united India, with a weak center (controlling defence, foreign affairs, communications) and provinces grouped into three sections (A, B, C) that would frame their constitutions
	- Interpretations:
		- The Mission's plan was ambivalent regarding compulsory vs. optional grouping, leading to different interpretations by the Congress (optional) and the League (compulsory)
		- The Mission eventually ruled in the League's favour. Both the League and Congress initially accepted the proposals
	- Subsequent Developments:
		- In July 1946, the Muslim League withdrew its acceptance after Nehru's statement on grouping and called for "Direct Action" from August 16, 1946, leading to widespread communal riots
		- Despite this, an Interim Government headed by Nehru was sworn in on September 2, 1946
		- The League later joined the Interim Government on October 26, 1946, adopting an obstructionist approach to fight for Pakistan from within the government
- Mountbatten Plan (June 3, 1947):
	- Mountbatten, with informal plenary powers and the British government's firm decision to quit, quickly concluded that partition was inevitable
	- Main Proposals:
		- Punjab and Bengal assemblies would vote for partition. If a simple majority voted for partition, these provinces would be divided, leading to two dominions and two constituent assemblies
		- Since the Congress had conceded a unified India, all their other points would be met, namely:
			- independence for princely states ruled out—they would join either India or Pakistan;
			- independence for Bengal ruled out
			- accession of Hyderabad to Pakistan ruled out
			- freedom to come on August 15, 1947
			- a boundary commission to be set up if partition was to be effected
		- Why Congress Accepted Dominion Status?
			- Congress was willing to accept dominion status despite its being against the Lahore Congress (1929) spirit because:
				- it would ensure a peaceful and quick transfer of power
				- it was more important for the Congress to assume authority to check the explosive situation
				- it would allow for some much needed continuity in the bureaucracy and the army
		- Referendums would be held in NWFP and Sylhet (Bengal)
	- The breakneck speed of events under Mountbatten caused anomalies in arranging the details of partition and totally failed to prevent the Punjab massacre
		- The early date, 15th August 1947, and the delay in announcing the Boundary Commission Award (Radcliffe Award), both Mountbatten’s decisions, compounded the tragedy that took place.
- Indian Independence Act (July 1947):
	- Based on the Mountbatten Plan, the Act was passed by the British Parliament
	- It provided for the creation of two independent dominions, India and Pakistan, from August 15, 1947
	- Each dominion was to have a governor-general to be responsible for the effective operation of the Act.
	- M.A. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan. India, however, decided to request Lord Mountbatten to continue as the Governor-General of India.
		


In summary, the British imperial power complicated the transfer of power in the 1940s through a series of tactical decisions and broader policies that, intentionally or unintentionally, deepened divisions, empowered communal factions, and accelerated a partition that they themselves were not fully prepared to manage in its catastrophic human consequences.
