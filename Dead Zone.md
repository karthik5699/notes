## Questions:

1. What are the consequences of spreading of ‘Dead Zones’ on marine ecosystem?

# Dead Zone

- Introduction
	- A **dead zone** is a region in the ocean (or sometimes in lakes/rivers) where the concentration of dissolved oxygen falls so low that most marine life cannot survive.
	- Oxygen depletion usually happens when excess nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus from fertilizers, sewage, etc.) fuel uncontrolled algal growth (algal bloom). 
	- When algae die, they sink and decompose, consuming oxygen.
	- The dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico is a stark example of this phenomenon. 
- Consequences
	- Collapse of marine biodiversity
		- Fish, crabs, mollusks, and other oxygen-dependent species either **flee** or **die**
	- Disruption of food chains
		- Loss of small creatures like clams and crabs at the bottom shakes the entire trophic pyramid.
	- **Habitat destruction**: 
		- Coral reefs and sea grass beds, already oxygen-sensitive, get damaged.
	- **Fisheries decline**: 
		- This directly hurts livelihoods of millions of coastal communities.
	- Altered carbon cycle: 
		- Dead zones encourage microbes that release methane and nitrous oxide—a greenhouse gas 300x stronger than CO₂.
- Conclusion
	- Ultimately, the spread of dead zones is a critical indicator of unsustainable human activity, which needs to be mitigated to achieve the goals of SDG 14 (Life below Water)
