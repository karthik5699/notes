# Medieval Temple Sculptures as Mirrors of Social Life

Introduction: Medieval Indian temple sculptures, spanning **Nagara** (northern) and **Dravida** (southern) styles, serve as visual chronicles of their times. Carved between the 8th–13th centuries, these reliefs go beyond divinities to portray the _mundane_—offering rich insights into contemporary economic life, professions, and daily activities. This integration of sacred and secular imagery across regions (from Khajuraho to Halebidu to Konark) underscores how temples became repositories of **social history**

- Temples feature figures of **traders, warriors, musicians, dancers, and priests**, showing the diversity of professions
- **At the Brihadeshwara Temple in Thanjavur**, sculptures of kings and nobles display intricate jewellery, while commoners are shown with simpler attire, illustrating social hierarchy in medieval India
- Sculptures depicting women as dancers and musicians highlight their involvement in cultural activities and their importance in medieval Indian society.

Thus, the medieval temple art – beyond its devotional purpose – provides a comprehensive panorama of social and economic life, underlining the complexity and continuity of India’s social fabric
