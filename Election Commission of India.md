## Questions:

1. Discuss the role of the Election Commission of India in light of the evolution of the Model Code of Conduct.

# Election Commission of India

- Introduction
	- The Election Commission of India (ECI), empowered by **Article 324** to ensure free and fair elections, has masterfully used the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) as its primary tool. 
	- The MCC's journey from a voluntary agreement to a powerful instrument is a testament to the ECI's evolving and proactive role.
- ECI's Role in the Evolution of the MCC:
	- **From Adoption to Assertion:** 
		- The MCC originated as a voluntary code among political parties in Kerala in 1960.
		- The ECI recognised its potential and adopted it for nationwide elections in 1962.
		- However, it remained a mere set of guidelines for decades.
	- **The T.N. Seshan Era:** 
		- In the 1990s, Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan transformed the MCC by enforcing it with unprecedented rigour. 
		- By taking decisive action against misuse of government machinery, personal attacks, and excessive expenditure, he established the ECI's authority and gave the MCC its formidable reputation.
	- **Dynamic Interpretation for Modern Challenges:** 
		- The ECI has continuously adapted the MCC to meet new challenges:
			- **Regulating Promises:** 
				- ECI incorporated guidelines to ensure the financial viability of promises made in party manifestos.
			- **Tackling the Digital Sphere:** 
				- The ECI has issued specific guidelines for social media use by parties and candidates to curb misinformation and hate speech. 
				- It has also launched tools like the **cVIGIL app**, empowering citizens to report violations of MCC in real-time.
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, the MCCâ€™s evolution is inseparable from the ECI's institutional assertion.
	- While debates on granting it statutory backing persist, its current non-statutory nature provides the ECI with the flexibility for rapid and decisive action, reinforcing its status as the guardian of Indian democracy.




## Personal Analysis:

The **Election Commission of India (ECI) has proposed that political party accounts be subject to independent scrutiny** either by the [[Comptroller & Auditor General]] or auditors recommended by the CAG
