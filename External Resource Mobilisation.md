## Questions:



# External Resource Mobilisation

- India mobilizes resources from two main external sources: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI).
- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
	- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): 
		- FDI involves long-term investments in productive assets, such as acquiring companies or setting up facilities. 
		- It brings capital, technology, and management expertise, driving economic growth and job creation.
	- Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI): 
		- FPI involves investments in financial assets like stocks and bonds. 
		- It is more speculative and provides market liquidity but lacks the long-term stability of FDI, often referred to as "hot money" due to its quick exit nature.
	- FDI in a New Global Order:
		- The current geopolitical landscape, marked by a global push to diversify supply chains away from China, presents a significant opportunity for India. 
		- The 'China+1' strategy involves multinational corporations setting up alternative manufacturing bases to de-risk their operations. 
		- India, with its large domestic market and democratic credentials, is a natural contender to attract this new wave of FDI.
		- Government initiatives like the [[Production Linked Incentive]] (PLI) schemes are specifically designed to attract global manufacturers in strategic sectors like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles and integrate India into global value chains.
	- Bridging the Gap between FDI MOUs to Actual Inflows:
		- A persistent challenge for India has been the gap between announced FDI intentions (Memorandums of Understanding) and the actual realisation of these investments on the ground.
		- This gap is often attributed to several factors:
			- Bureaucratic Hurdles: 
				- Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances remain a significant obstacle.
			- Infrastructure Deficits: 
				- Underdeveloped infrastructure increases operational and logistics costs for investors.
			- Land Acquisition: 
				- The process of acquiring land for large projects is often complex and fraught with delays.
			- Round Tripping
				- Round tripping via tax havens inflates FDI inflows by routing domestic funds as foreign investments, creating a false perception of foreign capital and widening the gap between announced FDI intentions (MOUs) and actual realized investments
	- Why has net FDI inflow plummeted?
		- Rising Repatriations and Outward Indian Investment
		- Global Economic uncertainty
		- Weak Global demand hurting Export-oriented sectors
		- Trade frictions leading to cautious approach from investors
		- Compositional shift in FDI inflows
