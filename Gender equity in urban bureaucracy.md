## Questions:



# Gender equity in urban bureaucracy

- By 2050, over 800 million Indians will live in cities, making India the largest driver of global urban growth.
- In the last three decades, progressive constitutional reforms have advanced gender equity.
- 73rd & 74th Constitutional Amendments mandate 33% reservation for women in PRIs and ULBs; 17 States/UTs raised this to 50%.
- As of 2024, 46% of local elected representatives are women (Ministry of Panchayati Raj).
- Persistent Bureaucratic Gender Gap
	- Only 20% of IAS are women
	- In policing, only 12% of the national force are women
	- Poor female representation in urban planning, engineering, and transport bodies
- Impact on Urban Planning
	- Women use public/shared transport more, yet infrastructure remains male-centric.
	- With few women in policing, community safety initiatives often fail to resonate with women.
- Gender Budgeting
	- Gender-responsive budgeting integrates gender considerations into public finance.
	- Under-utilised tool in India's urban governance
	- India adopted a Gender Based Budget Statement in 2005-06, with Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Kerala leading the efforts.
	- Yet, such efforts suffer from weak monitoring and limited institutional capacities.
- Way forward: From Representation to Inclusion
	- Go beyond political quotas: affirmative action in technical/bureaucratic roles.
	- Institutionalise gender audits, participatory budgeting, and local gender equity councils.
	- Leverage models like Kudumbashree for inclusive governance.
	- To build cities for women, we must start by building cities with women.
