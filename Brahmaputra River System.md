- Introduction
	- The Brahmaputra basin spreads over Tibet (China), Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh
	- In India, the basin spreads over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Nagaland, and Sikkim
	- The Brahmaputra River originates in the Kailash range near Mansarovar Lake in Tibet, where it is called the Tsangpo (‘the purifier’) or Yarlung Zangbo
	- It carves a deep gorge in the Central Himalayas near Namcha Barwa and turns southwards. Then, it enters India through Arunachal Pradesh as Dihang
	- The Brahmaputra enters Bangladesh as the Jamuna River, where it joins the Ganga (Padma in Bangladesh) and continues to flow as the Padma.
	- Padma finally joins Meghna River, which falls into the Bay of Bengal
	- The confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna Rivers forms the Sundarbans delta
	- The Brahmaputra is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">infamous for floods, channel shifting, and bank erosion</mark>. This is because most of its tributaries bring large quantities of sediments owing to heavy rainfall in its catchment area.
- Subansiri

	- It is an antecedent river that rises in the mountains of Tibet.
- Manas
