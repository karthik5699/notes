# Temperate Cyclones

The systems developing in the mid and high latitude (35° latitude and 65° latitude in both hemispheres), beyond the tropics are called the Temperate Cyclones or Extra Tropical Cyclones

- Origin and Development of Temperate Cyclones
	- Polar Front Theory 
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711154629.png]]
		- According to this theory, the warm-humid air masses from the tropics meet the dry-cold air masses from the poles and thus a polar front is formed as a surface of discontinuity
		- Such conditions occur over sub-tropical high, sub-polar low pressure belts and along the Tropopause
		- The cold air pushes the warm air upwards from underneath. Thus a void is created because of lessening of pressure. 
		- The surrounding air rushed in to occupy this void and coupled with the earth’s rotation, a cyclone is formed which advances with the westerlies (Jet Streams)
		- Details
			- In the northern hemisphere, warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the front
			- When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air moves northwards and the cold air move towards south setting in motion an anticlockwise cyclonic circulation (northern hemisphere). This is due to Coriolis Force.
			- The cyclonic circulation leads to a well-developed extra tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front.
			- There are pockets of warm air or warm sector wedged between the forward and the rear cold air or cold sector. The warm air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation
			- The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the cold front. 
			- The cold front moves faster than the warm front ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely lifted up and the front is occluded (occluded front) and the cyclone dissipates
			- So temperate cyclone is intense frontogenesis involving mainly occlusion type front
			- Precise movement of this weather system is controlled by the orientation of the polar jet stream in the upper troposphere
	- Seasonal Occurrence of Temperate Cyclones
		- The temperate cyclones occur mostly in winter, late autumn and spring. They are generally associated with rainstorms and cloudy weather
	- Distribution of Temperate Cyclones
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711161424.png]]
		- USA and Canada – extend over Sierra Nevada, Colorado, Eastern Canadian Rockies and the Great Lakes region,
		- the belt extending from Iceland to Barents Sea and continuing over Russia and Siberia,
		- Mediterranean basin extending up to Russia and even up to India in winters (called western disturbances) and the Antarctic frontal zone
- Characteristics of Temperate Cyclones
	- Size and Shape
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711170938.png]]
		- The temperate cyclones are asymmetrical and shaped like an inverted ‘V’.
		- They may spread over 2500 km over North America (Polar Vortex)
	- Orientation And Movement
		- Jet stream plays a major role in temperate cyclonogeneis
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711165611.png]]
		- Jet streams also influence the path of temperate cyclones.
		- Since these cyclones move with the westerlies (Jet Streams), they are oriented east-west
		- The Mediterranean cyclones or Western Disturbances are very important as they bring rains to North-West India – Punjab, Haryana
- Associated Weather
	- The approach of a temperate cyclone is marked by fall in temperature, fall in the mercury level, wind shifts and a halo around the sun and the moon, and a thin veil of cirrus clouds.
	- A light drizzle follows which turns into a heavy downpour. 
	- With the arrival of the warm front, these conditions shift — the temperature stabilizes
	- Rainfall stops and clear weather prevails until the cold front of an anticyclonic character arrives which causes a fall in temperature, brings cloudiness and rainfall with thunder. After this, once again clear weather is established.
	- The temperate cyclones experience more rainfall when there is slower movement and a marked difference in rainfall and temperature between the front and rear of the cyclone.
	- These cyclones are generally accompanied by anticyclones
