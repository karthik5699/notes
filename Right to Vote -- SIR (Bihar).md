# Right to Vote -- SIR (Bihar)

- Introduction
	- The right to vote in India, while the bedrock of its democracy, is not a fundamental right.
	- It is a **statutory right** flowing from the constitutional mandate of universal adult franchise enshrined in **Article 326**.
	- The Supreme Court, in cases like **_PUCL vs. Union of India (2013)_**, has consistently held this position, clarifying that the eligibility and procedure for voting are governed by the **Representation of the People Act, 1950 & 51**
- Special Intensive Revision
	- Electoral Rolls
		- Record of eligible voters in a constituency
		- 3 types
			- Summary Revision
			- Intensive Revision
			- Special Intensive Revision
		- The Election Commission of India's **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of electoral rolls is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">crucial exercise aimed at ensuring their purity and accuracy</mark>
	- Constitutional Support
		- Article 324 -> Empowers ECI to undertake tasks like preparation of electoral rolls, conduct of elections 
			- Mohinder Singh Gill Case (1978) --> Article 324 is a reservoir of power for ECI to conduct free and fair elections
	- Legal Support
		- Representation of People's Act 1950 --> governs the preparation of electoral rolls
		- Representation of People's Act 1951 --> conduct of elections / electoral offences
- Concerns
	- **Risk of Disenfranchisement:** 
		- The insistence on stringent documentation and short verification timelines can lead to large-scale exclusion, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups like migrant labourers (over 450 million)
		- While aimed at removing "errors of inclusion", SIR risks creating severe "errors of exclusion", thereby undermining the core objective of universal suffrage
	- **Shifting the Onus:** 
		- The process shifts the burden of proof from the state to the citizen
	- State capacity constraints to carry such a huge exercise
	- Fear of citizenship screening
- Supreme Court's Intervention
	- ECI's emphasis should be on inclusion over 'en masse exclusion'
	- Political Parties should take steps at the ground level to ensure eligible voters are included in the electoral rolls. (Lakshmi Charan Sen Case (1985))
- Case Studies
	- Sukumar Sen (1st Chief Election Commissioner)
		- To encourage voter participation, Sen introduced voting symbols for largely illiterate population of India
	- USA --> Absentee voting and mail-in ballots
	- Australia --> Mobile polling stations
- Conclusion
	- To conclude, while a clean electoral roll is essential for free and fair elections, the ECI must balance this objective with the constitutional imperative of universal adult franchise.
