# Nuclear energy

- Introduction
	- India is also planning a major expansion, aiming to increase its nuclear capacity from the current 7.5 GW to an ambitious 100 GW by 2047
	- At present, nuclear energy constitutes just over 3% of India's total electricity generation.
- Benefits of Nuclear Energy
	- Clean Source of Energy: 
		- It has a minimal carbon footprint, with greenhouse gas emissions that are about 100 times lower than those from coal-fired electricity.
	- Reliable and Continuous Power: 
		- Unlike wind or solar, nuclear power can provide a stable and perennial supply of electricity.
- Challenges of Nuclear Energy
	- Nuclear Waste Management: 
		- There is a lack of long-term disposal solutions for highly radioactive waste in India
	- High Capital Costs: 
		- Nuclear power plants require massive upfront financial investments and have very long payback periods, making financing a major challenge
	- Limited Domestic Fuel: 
		- India has scarce domestic uranium resources, which are insufficient to meet the demand of its nuclear power plants, leading to a reliance on imports.
- Availability of raw material for the generation of nuclear energy in India
	- Uranium: 
		- India's limited uranium deposits are primarily located in the Singhbhum belt of Jharkhand, the Cuddapah basin of Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Meghalaya.
		- India has agreements for uranium purchases with Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan.
	- Thorium: 
		- Abundant reserves of thorium are found within the monazite sands along the country's coastlines, with the highest concentrations on the beaches of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
