# India's Economic Future

- Introduction
	- The Government of India has articulated a vision for the nation to become a '<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Viksit Bharat</mark>' or developed India by 2047.
	- This ambitious goal envisages transforming India into a $30-trillion economy with a per capita income between $20,000 and $25,000.
- From a Lower- Middle Income to a $30- trillion Developed Economy
	- Currently, the World Bank classifies India as a lower-middle-income country with <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a per capita income of $2,612</mark>
	- Achieving 'developed' status requires a six-fold increase in per capita GNI
	- The four primary engines of development: agriculture, MSMEs, investments, and exports.
- Indiaâ€™s Strengths
	- High Economic Growth
		- 4th largest Global Economy
		- World's Fastest Growing Major Economy
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Real GDP: 6.5% growth</mark>
	- Demographic Potential
		- By 2030, Working Age Population (15-64) will reach 100 crores
		- One-fifth of Global Workforce
	- Large and expanding consumer market
		- Increasing per capita income is fuelling demand, making India preferred destination for global investors
	- Dynamic Services Sector
		- Key growth engine for economy
	- Macroeconomic stability
		- Stable policy environment
	- These strengths collectively position India as a resilient, opportunity-rich economy
- Critical Challenges to Achieving Developed Status
	- Despite its strengths, India faces formidable challenges that could derail its 2047 ambition. 
	- Historical precedent shows that many nations have been at a similar economic juncture but failed to transition to high-income status.
	- Challenges
		- Inadequate growth rate
			- Required: 8% growth rate for at least a decade
		- Middle Income Trap Risk
			- Occurs when low-wage manufacturing model runs out of steam before transitioning into high-value-added industries
		- Stalled Structural transformation
			- Agriculture: Employment (46%); GDP contribution (18% only)
			- Manufacturing has not grown fast enough to absorb surplus agricultural labour
			- Service sector hasn't created enough low-skill jobs
		- Jobs creation and Skills gap
			- Employability crisis: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Only 51% of Indian graduates are considered employable</mark>
			- Jobless growth: GDP increases without corresponding employment rise
		- Low investment and Consumption-led growth
			- Private Consumption: 60% of GDP
			- GFCF: 31% (2023-24)
			- Consumption-led model is less sustainable than investment-led growth for the long-term
- Strategic Actions Required for the 2047 Goal
	- Private Investment & Ease of Business
		- Govt must act as a facilitator not regulator to attract private investment through stable policy environment
		- Key initiatives
			- National Infrastructure Pipeline
			- PM Gati Shakti Program
			- Corporate Bond Market Reform
			- Minimise bureaucratic hurdles
	- Industrial policy and Manufacturing
		- Deep industrialisation necessary for job creation and moving labour out of agriculture
		- Focus Areas
			- Special focus on MSME growth
			- [[Production Linked Incentive]]
			- Export orientation and Global integration
	- China+1 Strategy
		- Attract Global Manufacturers
		- Maintain open trade policy
		- Resist high tariff wars
		- Negotiate trade agreements
	- Human Capital
		- Transform demographic potential into dividend
	- Agricultural Modernisation
		- Reduce dependency while increasing productivity
	- With strategic reforms, India can emerge not just as an economic powerhouse, but as a model of equitable and sustainable progress for the Global South.
- The Indian Economy and the Middle-Income Trap
	- MIT describes a systemic economic slowdown where rapidly growing economies stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to graduate to high-income status
	- India's ambition to become a developed economy is significant, yet several factors make it vulnerable to the MIT:
		- Untapped Human Capital & Skill Gap
		- India's R&D investment stands at a mere 0.64% of GDP, considerably lower than China's 2.4%
		- Rising Income Inequality
		- India leapfrogged from agriculture directly to the services sector
		- Middle-income countries are caught between advanced economies' rapid technological changes and competition from low-wage, poorer countries
	- The Way Forward
		- The World Development Report identifies three crucial drivers for escaping the MIT: Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation
		- Primarily for lower-middle-income countries like India, the focus should be on improving the investment climate to attract domestic and foreign capital, complemented by deliberate measures to adopt and diffuse modern technologies from abroad.
		- As countries mature, they must transition to becoming innovators themselves, creating new technologies and ideas to join the high-income club. 
		- Other vital initiatives include investing in secondary education and vocational training to build a skilled workforce, leveraging the diaspora's expertise, and focusing research funding on strategic STEM areas.
- Global Examples for Learning
	- South Korea's success stemmed from an interventionist state actively directing its conglomerates (chaebols) towards an aggressive, export-driven manufacturing model, growing its per capita income from $1,200 in 1960 to $33,000 by 2023.
