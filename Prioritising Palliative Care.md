# Prioritising Palliative Care

Millions in India suffer unnecessarily due to limited access to palliative care. 

> Palliative care is a holistic approach aimed at improving the quality of life for patients and their families facing serious or life-threatening illnesses. It focuses on preventing and relieving sufferingâ€”physical, psychological, social, and spiritual

Current Scenario & Gaps
- Despite a global need for palliative care (40 million annually), only 14% receive it. 
- In India, 7-10 million people need it yearly, but only 1-2% have access

Challenges in India:
- Uneven access, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas, despite inclusion in the National Health Policy 2017
- Severe shortage of trained palliative care professionals and limited specialised training for doctors
- Low public awareness leading to misconceptions and late access.

Recommendations for Improvement:
- Integrate palliative care into the core MBBS curriculum to train more doctors
- Empower allied healthcare professionals (nurses, etc.) through targeted training
- Expand insurance coverage (e.g., Ayushman Bharat) to include palliative care services
- Launch public awareness campaigns to demystify palliative care and encourage early access.
- Learn from models like the U.S. system regarding funding, insurance, and hospice care, adapting them to India's context
