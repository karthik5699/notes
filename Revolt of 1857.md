# Revolt of 1857

The Revolt was not a sudden event but rather the culmination of simmering discontent that had built up over a century of British colonial rule and policies. The causes were multi-faceted, affecting various sections of Indian society.

1. Economic Causes
	- the colonial policies of the East India Company destroyed the traditional economic fabric of Indian society
	- New and unpopular revenue settlements imposed disabilities on the peasantry from which they never really recovered
	- heavy taxation impoverished the peasants, forcing them to take loans from moneylenders/traders at exorbitant rates, leading to evictions from their land
	- Indian trade and mercantile classes were deliberately crippled by high tariff duties on Indian goods, while British imports had low tariffs, killing Indian manufacture
	- The ruin of Indian industry increased pressure on agriculture, which could not support everyone
2. Political Causes
	- Policies like ‘Effective Control’, ‘Subsidiary Alliance’, and the infamous ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ caused suspicion among almost all ruling princes
	- The annexation of Awadh in 1856 by Dalhousie, based on grounds of misgovernment, was considered a political blunder
		- Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was deposed and exiled, which deeply angered the people of Awadh
3. Administrative Causes
	- Rampant corruption in the Company’s administration, particularly among the police, petty officials, and lower law courts, was a major source of discontent
4. Socio-Religious Causes
	- Racial overtones and a superiority complex characterized the British attitude towards native Indians, leading to insults and contempt
	- The activities of Christian missionaries were viewed with suspicion
	- Attempts at social reform (abolition of sati, support for widow marriage, women’s education) were seen by large sections as interference in Indian social and religious customs
	- The government’s decision to tax mosque and temple lands added to fears
	- Rumours played a significant role, particularly concerning the greased cartridges for the new Enfield rifle, which were reportedly coated with beef and pig fat, offensive to both Hindus and Muslims. The Army administration failed to allay these fears
5. Military Causes
	- Discrimination in payment and promotions and mistreatment of sepoys by British officers caused resentment
	- Refusal to pay foreign service allowance for fighting in remote regions also contributed to discontent
	- The sepoys shared the general discontent and grievances of the civilian population; a sepoy was often described as a 'peasant in uniform'
		- The new land revenue system in Awadh, where many sepoys were recruited, directly affected their families
6. Influence of Outside Events
	- British defeats in the First Afghan War (1838-42), Punjab Wars (1845-49), and the Crimean Wars (1854-56) exposed British vulnerability and made Indians feel they could be defeated


#### Major Events
1. Early Incidents

	- Lucknow: Begum Hazrat Mahal
	- Jhansi: Rani Laxmibai, was later joined by Tantia Tope

	- Bihar (Jagdishpur): Kunwar Singh
4. Suppression of the Revolt
	- The British, unnerved by the scale, suppressed the revolt with full force
