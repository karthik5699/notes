# Indian Secularism

- Introduction
	- The Preamble of the Indian Constitution declares India as a secular state.
	- Indian secularism is a complex and often contested principle, differing significantly from Western models of secularism. 
	- It is characterized by a "principled distance" rather than a strict "wall of separation" between the state and religion
- Constitutional Foundations and Normative Principles:
	- Preamble: 
		- The term 'secular' was explicitly added to the Preamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment in 1976, affirming India as a "sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic". 
		- Even before this secularism was an implicit constitutional value.
	- Fundamental Rights (Part III):
		- Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, regardless of religion
		- Article 15(1) and (2) prohibit discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth
		- Articles 25-28 guarantee freedom of religion
			- Article 25: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion
			- Article 26: Freedom to manage religious affairs
			- Article 27: No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes for the promotion of any particular religion
			- Article 28: No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institute completely maintained by state
		- Articles 29 and 30 secure cultural and educational rights of minorities
	- Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV)
		- Article 51A(e) emphasizes the duty to promote harmony and renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women, indirectly challenging regressive religious norms
- Nature of Indian Secularism
	- Christophe Jeffrelot argues that Indian secularism is not a post-independence invention but it emerged from Indian culture of tolerance practiced by Ashoka and Akbar. Indian secularism is a by-product of Indian civilisation.
	- Mahatma Gandhi advocated for "sarva dharma sambhava" (equal respect for all religions) as a principle to unite people of different faiths
	- Jawaharlal Nehru initially favoured "dharma nirpekshata" (state neutrality towards religion) but, in response to communal conflicts and Partition, adopted a view closer to Gandhi's
	- Rajeev Bhargava described the model of Indian secularism as "principled distance". It emphasis:
		- Equal respect for all religions (sarva dharma sambhava), 
		- State neutrality without indifference, and 
		- A reformist orientation that allows state intervention for constitutional morality and social justice. 
	- This model promotes religious pluralism and social justice concurrently.
- Judicial Interpretations and Doctrines
	- Basic Structure Doctrine: 
		- In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court declared secularism a part of the basic structure of the Constitution
	- S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994): 
		- The Supreme Court asserted that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution
	- Essential Practices Doctrine: 
		- Established in Shirur Mutt case (1954), this doctrine distinguishes between "essential religious practices" (protected) and non-essential, secular aspects (open to state intervention). 
		- This doctrine has been criticized for allowing courts to interpret theology and exercise epistemic control over religion. 
			- Gautam Bhatia, "Courts should refrain from making value judgements about religious practices"
			- Faizan Mustafa, "Courts have taken the role of clergy in determining what is essential and what is non-essential religious practice"
		- For example
			- In the Sabarimala Temple Case (2018), the Court struck down the ban on women's entry as unconstitutional, prioritizing gender equality over a deemed non-essential practice
			- In Shayara Bano case (2017), the SC declared the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional and void, deeming it a non-essential practice
- Criticism
	- Scholars like **Ashis Nandy, T.N. Madan, and Partha Chatterjee** have critically assessed secularism, arguing it is an alien concept in India, has failed to prevent communalism, or has been selectively applied by the state
- Conclusion
	- To preserve the secular character of India’s democracy, the state must reaffirm its commitment to equitable neutrality, protect minority rights, and resist majoritarian pressures.




## Personal Analysis:

Secularism is about managing the relationship between religion and politics
