# Free Trade Agreements

- Introduction
	- Free Trade Agreement is a **pact between two or more countries** to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in goods and services
	- Barriers include **tariffs** (taxes on imports), **quotas** (limits on quantity), and **non-tariff barriers** (like safety standards, licensing, or subsidies).
	- Purpose: encourage economic integration, expand market access, enhance competitiveness.
- Position in trade integration ladder:
	- Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA): 
		- Limited tariff reduction on select goods
	- FTA: 
		- Elimination of tariffs on most goods & services.
	- Customs Union: 
		- Common external tariff policy.
	- Common Market: 
		- Free movement of goods, services, labour, and capital
	- Economic Union: 
		- Full economic integration, common policies.
- Objectives of FTAs
	- Boost exports and imports by creating easier market access
	- Attract foreign investment by ensuring predictability.
	- Enable technology transfer and innovation.
	- Improve competitiveness of domestic industries by exposure to global players
	- Strengthen strategic and diplomatic ties
- Features of FTAs
	- Negative list: 
		- sensitive items excluded from tariff cuts (e.g., agriculture, defense).
	- Rules of origin: 
		- ensure only goods from partner countries benefit (avoid third-party misuse)
	- Trade remedies: 
		- safeguard measures against sudden import surges
	- Dispute resolution mechanism: 
		- structured consultation and arbitration
	- Increasingly cover new-age issues: 
		- digital trade, e-commerce, IPR
- India and FTAs
	- India’s FTAs evolved in three waves:
		- Early 2000s: 
			- ASEAN, Sri Lanka, Thailand – enthusiasm for globalization
		- 2010s: 
			- Pause due to trade imbalances (e.g., RCEP negotiations dropped in 2019)
		- Post-2020s: 
			- Selective re-engagement (Australia, UAE, EU under negotiation).
	- Major FTAs/CEPAs
		- India–Sri Lanka FTA (1998)
		- India–ASEAN FTA (2009)
		- India–South Korea CEPA (2010).
		- India–Japan CEPA (2011).
		- India–UAE CEPA (2022).
		- India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) (2022)
		- India-UK CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) (2025)
- Benefits for India
	- Greater market access for pharma, textiles, IT, and agriculture
	- Diversification of export destinations (reducing reliance on US/EU)
	- Boost to Make in India and global value chains participation
- Challenges with FTAs
	- Trade Deficits: 
		- India often imports more than exports (e.g., with ASEAN, Korea, Japan)
	- Non-Tariff Barriers: 
		- Partner countries impose strict standards, making Indian exports uncompetitive
	- Low Utilization Rate: 
		- Indian businesses underuse FTAs (avg. <25%) due to lack of awareness, complex compliance
	- Agriculture & MSME Concerns: 
		- Fear of being swamped by cheaper imports
- India’s Evolving Strategy
	- Shift from broad-based agreements (like RCEP) → targeted bilateral FTAs with strategic/economic partners
	- Focus on balancing trade by securing greater access for competitive sectors (pharma, IT)
	- Strengthen domestic manufacturing through Production Linked Incentives (PLIs) to withstand import competition
