# Laurentian Climate

- Introduction
	- Intermediate type of climate between the British Type Climate (moderate) and the Taiga Type Climate (extreme)
	- It has features of both the maritime and the continental climates
- Distribution of Laurentian Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250717161910.png]]
	- Laurentian type of climate is found only in two regions and that too only in the northern hemisphere.
	- North-eastern North America, including eastern Canada, north-east U.S.A., and Newfoundland. 
	- Eastern coastlands of Asia, including eastern Siberia, North China, Manchuria, Korea and northern Japan
- Laurentian Climate
	- Temperature
		- Characterized by cold, dry winters and warm, wet summers
		- Winter temperatures is below freezing-point and snow fall is quite natural.
		- Summers are as warm as the tropics (~25 °C).
	- Precipitation
		- Rainfall occurs throughout the year with summer maxima 
		- Annual rainfall ranges from 75 to 150 cm
		- Dry Westerlies that blow from continental interiors dominate winters
	- The North American region
		- ![[Pasted image 20250717165713.png]]
		- In summer, prolonged heat waves cause discomfort.
		- In winter, the temperature drops below freezing and snowfall occurs
		- Precipitation occurs all-round the year due to the influence of Atlantic ocean (summer) and the Great Lakes (winter)
		- The warm Gulf Stream increases the moisture of easterly winds
		- The prevailing Westerlies carry depressions over the Great Lakes towards eastern regions causing wet conditions in winter
		- Convergence of the warm Gulf Stream and the cold Labrador Current near Newfoundland produces dense mist and fog and gives rise to much precipitation.
	- The Asiatic region
		- Rainfall distribution of the Asiatic region is far less uniform when compared to North American Region.
		- Winters are cold and very dry while summers are very warm and exceptionally wet
		- The rainfall regime resembles the **tropical monsoon type** in India
		- Intense heating of the mountainous interior of China in summer creates a region of extreme low pressure, and moisture-laden winds from the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan blow in as the South-East Monsoon
		- Thus the Laurentian type of climate in China is often described as the Cool Temperate Monsoon Climate
		- Much of the winter precipitation in northern China, Korea and Hokkaido, Japan, is in the form of **snow.**
	- Japan
		- ![[Pasted image 20250717170940.png]]
		- The climate of Japan is modified by the meeting of warm and cold ocean currents
		- It receives adequate rainfall from both the South-East Monsoon in summer and the North- West Monsoon in winter
		- The warm Kuroshio makes the climate of Japan less extreme
		- The meeting zone between warm Kuroshio from south and cold Oyashio from the north produce fog and mist, making north Japan a ‘second Newfoundland’.
		- **_Fishing_** replaces agriculture as the main occupation in many of the **indented coastlands**.
- Natural Vegetation – Laurentian Climate
	- The predominant vegetation is cool temperate forest.
	- In the Asiatic region (eastern Siberia and Korea), the coniferous forests are a continuation of the great coniferous belt of the taiga
	- Lumbering
		- **Timber** and **fish** are the leading export items.
- Economic Development
	- Lumbering and its associated timber, paper and pulp industries are the most important economic undertaking
	- Agriculture is less important because of long and severe winters.
	- The **Annapolis valley in Nova Scotia** is the world’s most renowned region for **apples.**
		- ![[Pasted image 20250717171507.png]]
	- Fishing is, however, the most outstanding economic activity.
	- Fishing off Newfoundland
		- ![[Pasted image 20250717171645.png]]
		- Regions around the Grand Banks of Newfoundland are the world’s largest fishing grounds.
		- Mixing of warm Gulf Stream and cold Labrador currents make the region the most productive fishing ground on earth.
		- Fish feed on minute marine organisms called plankton. Plankton is abundantly available in shallow waters (continental shelves) where they have access to both sunlight as well as nutrients. Also, cold and warm water mixing creates upwelling of cold nutrient rich water to the surface. 
	- Why is fishing the dominant occupation of Japan?
		- ![[Pasted image 20250717173408.png]]
		- The mountainous nature of Japan and parts of mainland eastern Asia support little agricultural activity 
		- Japan is not well endowed with natural resources. So, she has to take to the sea if she wants to survive
		- The continental shelves around the islands of Japan are rich in plankton, due to the meeting of the warm Kuroshio and the cold Oyashio currents and provide excellent breeding grounds for all kinds of fish.
		- The **indented coastline of Japan**, provides **sheltered fishing ports**, calm waters and safe landing places, ideal for the fishing industry.
