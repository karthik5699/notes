## Questions:



# Atmosphere

- Our planet earth is enveloped by a deep blanket of gases extending several thousands of kilometres above its surface. This gaseous cover of the earth is known as the atmosphere
- Compared to the earth’s radius, the atmosphere appears to be only a very thin layer of gases. However, because of the force of gravity, it is inseparable from the earth
- **Atmospheric pressure:** 
	- The air exerts pressure on earth’s surface by virtue of its weight. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure. 
	- Atmospheric pressure is the most important climatic element.

Role of Earth's Atmosphere
- Contains various gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen etc.
- Plants require carbon dioxide to survive while animals and many other organisms need oxygen for their survival. The atmosphere supplies these life giving gases.
- the atmosphere **regulates the entry of solar radiation**.
- The atmosphere also keeps the temperature over the earth’s surface within certain limits
- Harmful ultraviolet radiation would find its way through, if the atmosphere (ozone in stratosphere to be specific) were absent

#### Composition of Atmosphere

- ![[Pasted image 20250703160343.png]]
- The atmosphere is a mixture of many gases. In addition, it contains huge numbers of solid and liquid particles, collectively called **‘aerosols’.**
- **Nitrogen and oxygen** make up nearly **99%** of the clean, dry air. The remaining gases are mostly **inert** and constitute about 1% of the atmosphere.
- Besides these gases, large quantities of water vapour and dust particles are also present in the atmosphere. These solid and liquid particles are of great climatic significance

Oxygen
- **21%** of total volume of atmosphere
- All living organisms inhale oxygen
- Also, combustion is not possible without oxygen.

Nitrogen
- **78%** of total atmospheric volume
- It is a relatively inert gas, and is an important constituent of all organic compounds
- The main function of nitrogen is to control combustion by diluting oxygen

Carbon Dioxide
- only about 0.3% of the dry air and is a product of combustion
- Green plants, through photosynthesis, absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
- Being an efficient absorber of heat, carbon dioxide is considered to be of great climatic significance. 
- Carbon dioxide is considered to be a very important factor in the heat energy budget.
- With increased burning of fossil fuels – oil, coal and natural gas – the carbon dioxide percentage in the atmosphere has been increasing at an alarming rate.
- More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat absorption. 
	- This could significantly raise the temperature at lower levels of the atmosphere thus inducing drastic climatic changes

Ozone (03)
- is **unevenly distributed**. 
- It is between **20 km and 25** km altitude that the greatest concentrations of ozone are found.
- It is formed at higher altitudes and transported downwards.
- Ozone plays a crucial role in blocking the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun

Water Vapour
- In the warm and wet tropics, it may account for 4% of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions, it may be less than 1% of the air.
- 90% of moisture content in the atmosphere exists within 6 km of the surface of the earth.
- Like carbon dioxide, water vapour plays a significant role in the insulating action, of the atmosphere.
- It absorbs not only the long-wave terrestrial radiation (infrared or heat emitted by earth during nights), but also a part of the incoming solar radiation
- Water vapour is the source of precipitation and clouds. 
- On condensation, it releases latent heat of condensation —the ultimate driving force behind all storms
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The moisture – carrying capacity of air is directly proportional to the air temperature</mark>

Solid Particles
- The Solid Particles present in the atmosphere consist of sand particles (from weathered rocks and also derived from volcanic ash), pollen grains, small organisms, soot, ocean salts
- These solid particles perform the function of absorbing, reflecting and scattering the radiation
- The solid particles are, consequently, responsible for the **orange and red colours** at sunset and sunrise
- ![[Pasted image 20250703162718.png]]
- The blue colour of the sky is also due to **_selective scattering_** by dust particles.
- Some of the dust particles are hygroscopic (i.e. readily absorbing moisture from air) in character, and as such, act as nuclei of condensation. 
	- Thus, dust particles are an important contributory factor in the formation of clouds, fog and hailstones.

##### Major Greenhouse Gases
- Carbon dioxide
	- It is transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the outgoing terrestrial radiation. 
	- It absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth’s surface. It is largely responsible for the greenhouse effect.
- Ozone
- Water Vapour
	- It absorbs not only the long-wave terrestrial radiation (infrared or heat emitted by earth during nights), but also a part of the incoming solar radiation 
- Methane
	- One of the most important greenhouse gases. 
	- It is produced from decomposition of animal wastes and biological matter.

#### Structure of Atmosphere
- The atmosphere can be studied as a layered entity – each layer having its own peculiar characteristics
- ![[Pasted image 20250703163719.png]]
- Troposphere
	- It is the atmospheric layer between the earth’s surface and an altitude of 8 km at the poles and 18 km at the equator
	- The thickness is greater at the equator, because the heated air rises to greater heights
	- The troposphere ends with the Tropopause
	- The temperature in this layer, as one goes upwards, falls at the rate of 5°C per kilometer, and reaches -45°C at the poles and -80°C over the equator at Tropopause
	- The fall in temperature is called **‘lapse rate’.**
	- The troposphere is marked by temperature inversion, turbulence and eddies
	- Almost all the weather phenomena like rainfall, fog and hailstorm etc. are confined to this layer
- Tropopause
	- It acts as a boundary between troposphere and stratosphere
	- This layer is marked by constant temperatures
- Stratosphere
	- It lies beyond troposphere, up to an altitude of 50 km from the earth’s surface
	- The temperature in this layer remains constant for some distance but then rises to reach a level of 0°C at 50 km altitude
	- This rise is due to the presence of ozone (harmful ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by ozone)
	- This layer is almost free from clouds and associated weather phenomenon, making conditions most ideal for flying aeroplanes
	- Sometimes, **cirrus clouds** are present at lower levels in this layer.
- Ozonosphere
	- It lies at an altitude between 30 km and 60 km from the earth’s surface and spans the stratosphere and lower mesosphere
	- The ozonosphere is also called chemosphere because, a lot of chemical activity goes on here
	- The temperature rises at a rate of 5°C per kilometer through the ozonosphere
- Mesosphere
	- an intermediate layer beyond the ozone layer and continues upto an altitude of 80 km from the earth’s surface
	- Meteorites burn up in this layer on entering from the space
- Thermosphere
	- In thermosphere temperature rises very rapidly with increasing height
	- Ionosphere is a part of this layer. It extends between 80-400 km
	- This layer helps in radio transmission
	- The International Space Station and satellites orbit in this layer.
		- Person would not feel warm because of the thermosphere’s extremely low pressure.
			- Feeling warmth depends on how many air molecules collide with your skin and transfer heat.
			- In the thermosphere, there aren’t enough molecules to transfer heat to your body
	- Aurora’s are observed in lower parts of this layer
- Ionosphere
	- located between 80 km and 400 km and is an electrically charged layer
	- This layer is characterized by ionization of atoms
	- Because of the electric charge, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer
- Exosphere
	- This is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere extending beyond the ionosphere above a height of about 400 km
	- The air is extremely rarefied and the temperature gradually increases through the layer
	- Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into the space from here.
