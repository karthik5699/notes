	- It is so named after a province of Yugoslavia on the Adriatic sea coast where such formations are most noticeable.
	- Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum.

	- ![[Pasted image 20250722151253.png]]
	- The water containing limestone in solution, seeps through the roof in the form of a continuous chain of drops.
	- A portion of the roof hangs on the roof and on evaporation of water, a small deposit of limestone is left behind contributing to the formation of a stalactite, growing downwards from the roof
	- The remaining portion of the drop falls to the floor. This also evaporates, leaving behind a small deposit of limestone aiding the formation of a stalagmite, thicker and flatter, rising upwards from the floor.
	- Sometimes, stalactite and stalagmite join together to form a complete pillar known as the column.
