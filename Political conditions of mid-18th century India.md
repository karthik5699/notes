# Political conditions of mid-18th century India

In the mid-eighteenth century, India experienced a profound political transformation marked by the spectre of a fragmented polity. This fragmentation was primarily a consequence of the decline of the mighty Mughal Empire and the subsequent emergence of numerous independent or semi-independent regional states across the subcontinent.

The decline of the Mughal Empire became pronounced after the reign of Aurangzeb (1658-1707), with his misguided policies weakening the state's stability. Following his death, the central authority in Delhi could no longer effectively function, as Mughal governors (subahdars) and big zamindars began to assert their authority and establish regional kingdoms. 

The political landscape thus became a patchwork of diverse entities:

- Successor States: 
	- These were former Mughal provinces that carved out virtually independent and hereditary authorities, including Awadh, Bengal, and Hyderabad. 
	- For example, Murshid Quli Khan established himself in Bengal in 1717, Saadat Khan in Awadh in 1722, and Nizam-ul-Mulk in Hyderabad in 1724
- Independent Kingdoms
	- These states came into existence primarily due to the destabilisation of the Mughal control over the provinces, examples being Mysore and the Rajput states
- New States - Maratha Confederacy
	- The Marathas aimed to inherit the imperial mantle. 
	- Although their dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered after their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, they continued as a confederacy under various chiefs like the Sindhia, Holkar, Gaikwad, and Bhonsle, albeit with a loose political setup and internal rivalries

These newly formed regional states, while strong enough to challenge Mughal power, were unable to replace it with a stable polity at an all-India level. They often suffered from constant warfare with neighbouring powers, preventing any single entity from dominating. 

This "divided house" of India, characterized by intense inter-border disputes and internal challenges, ultimately created an opportune environment for the British to increase their political influence and eventually establish dominance.
