![[Pasted image 20250915211507.png]]

- Introduction
	- India’s coffee exports have increased significantly by about 125% over the last 11 years, reaching USD 1.8 billion. 
	- India is now the seventh-largest coffee producer globally.
- India produces two types of coffee:
	- Arabica: 30% of production, higher quality.
	- Robusta: 70% of production, more disease-resistant.
- Factors Determining the Location of Coffee Industry
	- Coffee cultivation is restricted to the "<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">bean belt</mark>" region around the equator, between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, due to its ideal growing conditions
	- Climate: Requires a hot and humid climate (15-28°C, 150-250 cm rainfall).
	- Soil: Well-drained loamy soil
	- Vegetation: Grown under shady trees
	- Topography: Hill slopes at elevations of 600-1,600 meters above sea level
	- Capital and Labour: Capital-intensive, labour-intensive industry
- Geographical Distribution
	- Karnataka: 
		- The leading producer, accounting for about 70% of India’s coffee production
	- Kerala: 
		- 21% of total production
	- Tamil Nadu: 
		- 5% of total production (Nilgiri district)
- Export Orientation
	- Unlike tea (mostly consumed domestically), 70% of Indian coffee is exported, especially to Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Russia.
- Challenges
	- Climate Change: 
		- Erratic rainfall patterns and increased pest and disease incidence
		- Deforestation for expanding coffee estates in Western Ghats impacts biodiversity.
	- Small Holdings: 
		- 98% of coffee growers are small farmers with an average farm size of 2-3 hectares.
	- Competition: 
		- From major producers like Brazil and Vietnam
- Government Initiatives
	- Coffee Board of India: 
		- Established in 1942 to develop the coffee industry, providing research, financial assistance, and marketing support.
