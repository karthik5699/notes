## Questions:

1. Explain the reasons for the growth of public interest litigations in India. As a result of it, has the Indian Supreme Court emerged as the world's most powerful judiciary?

# Public Interest Litigations

- Introduction
	- Public interest litigations emerged in the late 1970s as a significant judicial innovation, relaxing the traditional rule of locus standi.
	- It empowered public-spirited individuals to approach the curt on behalf of marginalised sections of society
- Reasons for the growth of PIL
	- Judicial Innovation
		- Led by pioneers like Justice P.N. Bhagawati, the Supreme Court diluted the rule of locus standi, even admitting letters and postcards as writ petitions
	- Governance Deficit
		- Widespread executive inaction and legislative vacuum in addressing the grievances of the poor created a space for the judiciary to intervene and enforce fundamental rights
	- Expansive Constitutional Interpretation
		- The SC adopted an activist approach, expansively interpreting Article 21 to include the right to a clean environment, livelihood, and education
	- Proactive judiciary
		- SC began taking suo motu cognizance of issues based on media reports, especially concerning human rights violation
- Emergence as the World's Most Powerful Judiciary?
	- The growth of PIL has led scholar Upendra Baxi to term the Indian Supreme Court as arguably the 'world's most powerful'
	- Arguments in favour
		- Through PIL, the SC has ventured into policy-making domains traditionally reserved for the executive, issuing directives on everything from pollution control (CNG vehicles in Delhi) to electoral reforms.
		- This has made it a vital check on executive and legislative power. 
	- Counter-Arguments
		- However, this has also triggered accusations of judicial overreach and upsetting the delicate separation of powers
- Conclusion
	- While PIL has undoubtedly made the Supreme Court a formidable protector of citizens' rights, its immense power necessitates judicial restraint.
