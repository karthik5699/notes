# Role of Moderates in freedom struggle

The Moderates played a significant role in the early phase of the Indian freedom struggle, particularly from 1885 to 1905.

- Definition and Key Leaders:
	- The term "Moderates" refers to national leaders who dominated Congress policies during the early period and were strong believers in 'liberalism' and 'moderate' politics
	- Important leaders included Dadabhai Naoroji, Pherozshah Mehta, D.E. Wacha, W.C. Bonnerjea & Gopala Krishna Gokhale
- Objectives and Goals:
	- They demanded a greater voice for Indians in the government and in administration, seeking to make Legislative Councils more representative with increased powers
	- They demanded that Indians be placed in high government positions and called for civil service examinations to be held in India, not just London, as part of a movement against racism and to reduce the "drain of wealth" to England
	- By 1904-1906, prominent Moderates like Dadabhai Naoroji and G.K. Gokhale began advocating for self-government (Swaraj) on the lines of self-governing British colonies like Canada and Australia
- Methods and Approach:
	- The Moderates believed that the British basically wanted to be just to the Indians but were not aware of the real conditions. 
		- Therefore, if public opinion could be created in the country and public demands be presented to the government through resolutions, petitions, meetings, etc., the authorities would concede these demands gradually.
	- They used the method of '<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">prayer and petition</mark>' and resorted to constitutional agitation if those failed
	- Moderates, were the first to develop <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">an economic critique of colonialism</mark>. They published newspapers, wrote articles, and criticized British rule in speeches to raise public awareness about its unjust nature and economic impact
- Key Contributions:
	- Economic Critique of British Imperialism: 
		- Dadabhai Naoroji and R.C. Dutt, meticulously analyzed the political economy of British rule and developed the "drain theory" to expose British exploitation of India
	- Constitutional Reforms and Propaganda in Legislature: 
		- Despite limited power, Moderates like Pherozshah Mehta and G.K. Gokhale effectively used legislative councils as platforms to ventilate popular grievances, expose bureaucratic flaws, and criticize government policies
	- Defence of Civil Rights: 
		- They <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">incessantly campaigned for civil rights</mark>, including freedom of speech, thought, association, and a free press. This became an integral part of the freedom struggle
	- Laying Foundations for Nationalism: 
		- They played a crucial role in creating a common political platform, fostering national unity, and developing an anti-colonial ideology rooted in a scientific analysis of colonialism
- Criticisms and Limitations
	- Narrow Social Base: 
		- The moderate phase had a narrow social base, with masses playing a passive role. 
		- Early nationalists lacked political faith in the masses, believing them to be ignorant and divided
	- Politics of Prayer: 
		- Younger elements within the Congress and later Extremists criticized their methods of peaceful and constitutional agitation, often calling them "political mendicancy"
	- Their politics were based on the belief that they would be able to persuade the rulers to introduce economic and political reforms but their practical achievements in this respect were meagre.
	- Their basic failure, however, was that of not keeping pace with events. They could not see that their own achievements had made their Politics obsolete. They failed to meet the demands of the new stage of the national movement
	- Later, the government adopted a 'carrot and stick' policy to divide and isolate them from the Extremists, a strategy that unfortunately proved successful at Surat
- Relationship with Extremists
	- The Moderate-Extremist dispute over the pace of the movement and techniques of struggle reached a deadlock at the Surat session of the Indian National Congress (1907) where the party split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement


In essence, the Moderates, through their intellectual work, constitutional agitation, and emphasis on civil liberties and economic critique, prepared the ideological and political groundwork that enabled the later mass movements to flourish.
