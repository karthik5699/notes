# Location of Industries

- Introduction
	- Location of industries is influenced by factors like access to raw materials, power, market, capital, transport and labour, etc
- Geographical Factors:
	- Raw Materials → Industry Location: 
		- Proximity to sources, crucial for heavy/perishable materials  
		- e.g., sugar mills near sugarcane fields, copper smelting near ore deposits.
	- Power Sources → Energy-Intensive Industries: 
		- Steady supply (coal, oil, hydro) essential  
		- e.g., aluminium and synthetic nitrogen plants cluster near power sources.
	- Labour Availability → Manufacturing Centers: 
		- Access to skilled, cost-effective workforce  
		- e.g., light consumer goods and agro-based industries grow in populous regions
	- Transport → Industrial Efficiency: 
		- Well-developed land/water connectivity 
		- Brings raw material inflow and product distribution, supporting industrial growth.
	- Market Proximity → Reduced transport costs → competitive pricing  
		- e.g., textile industries in Mumbai, Ahmedabad
	- Site → Industrial Setup: 
		- Flat terrain, good connectivity, enough space  
		- ideal for factory establishment
	- Climate Influence → Sector-Specific Locations: 
		- Moderate conditions preferred  
		- e.g., humid climate in Maharashtra, Gujarat fosters cotton textile industry, preventing thread breakage.
- Non – Geographical Factors:
	- Capital Availability → High investment needs  
		- industries concentrate in finance-rich urban centers 
		- e.g., Mumbai's finance and textile industries.
	- Government Policies → Strategic policies shape industrial locations → aimed at balanced growth, pollution control 
		- e.g., Bengaluru's IT hub emergence.
	- Industrial Inertia → Historical Centers: 
		- Industries grow in original locations  
		- e.g., Ahmedabad's continued prominence in textiles.
- World Industrial Regions
	- ![[Pasted image 20250914154850.png]]
	- Major industrial regions tend to be located in the temperate areas, near sea ports and especially near coal fields.
