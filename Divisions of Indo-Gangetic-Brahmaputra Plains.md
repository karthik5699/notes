# Divisions of Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plains

![[Pasted image 20250726170635.png]]
- Regional Divisions of the Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra Plains
	- Sindh Plain (Pakistan)
		- Mainly formed of Bhangar Plains
	- Rajasthan Plain
		- Occupied by Thar or the Great Indian Desert.
		- This plain is an undulating plain 
		- The desert region is called Marusthali and forms a greater part of the Marwar plain
		- In general, the eastern part of the Marusthali is rocky while its western part is covered by shifting sand dunes locally known as Tibba
		- The eastern part of the Thar Desert up to the Aravali Range is a semi-arid plain known as Rajasthan Bagar.
		- It is drained by a number of short seasonal streams originating from the Aravali and supports agriculture in some patches of fertile tracts.
		- Luni is an important seasonal stream which flows into Rann of Kuchchh
		- Saline Lakes
			- North of the Luni, there is inland drainage having several saline lakes. They are a source of common salt and many other salts.
			- Sambhar, Didwana, Degana, Kuchaman, etc. are some of the important lakes. The largest is the Sambhar lake near Jaipur.
	- Punjab Plain
		- ![[Pasted image 20250726173544.png]]
		- This plain is formed by five important rivers of Indus system.
		- The plain is primarily made up of ‘doabs’ —the land between two rivers.
		- The depositional process by the rivers has united these doabs giving an homogenous appearance.
		- Punjab literally means “(The Land of) Five Waters” referring to the following rivers: the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas.
		- The eastern boundary of Punjab Haryana plain is marked by subsurface Delhi-Aravali ridge.
		- The northern part of this plain (Shiwalik hills) has been intensively eroded by numerous streams called Chos. This has led to enormous gullying.
		- To the south of the Satluj river there is Malwa plain of Punjab.
		- The area between the Ghaggar and the Yamuna rivers lies in Haryana and often termed as ‘Haryana Tract’. 
		- The only river between the Yamuna and the Satluj is the Ghaggar which is considered to be the present day Successor of the legendary Saraswati River
	- Ganga Plain
		- This is the largest unit of the Great Plain of India stretching from Delhi to Kolkata
		- The Ganga along with its large number of tributaries originating in the Himalayans have brought large quantities of alluvium from the mountains and deposited it here to build this extensive plain
		- The peninsular rivers such as Chambal, Betwa, Ken, Son, etc. joining the Ganga river system have also contributed to the formation of this plain
		- Rivers flow sluggishly in the lower sections of Ganges as a result of which the area is marked by local prominences such as levees, bluffs, oxbow lakes, marshes, ravines, etc. ([[Fluvial Erosional Landforms]])
		- Almost all the rivers keep on shifting their courses making this area prone to frequent floods. The Kosi river is very notorious in this respect. It has long been called the ‘Sorrow of Bihar’
	- Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta
		- This is the largest delta in the world.
		- The seaward face of the delta is studded with a large number of estuaries, mud flats, mangrove swamps, sandbanks, islands and forelands.
		- Large part of the coastal delta is covered tidal forests. These are called the Sunderbans because of the predominance of Sundri tree here.
	- Brahmaputra Plain
		- This is also known as the Brahmaputra valley or Assam Valley or Assam Plain as most of the Brahmaputra valley is situated in Assam
		- Its western boundary is formed by the Indo-Bangladesh border as well as the boundary of the lower Ganga Plain. Its eastern boundary is formed by Purvanchal hills.
		- The innumerable tributaries of the Brahmaputra river coming from the north form a number of alluvial fans. Consequently, the tributaries branch out in many channels giving birth to river meandering leading to formation of bill and ox-bow lakes.
- Significance of the Plain
	- This one fourth of the land of the country hosts half of the Indian population.
	- Fertile alluvial soils, flat surface, slow moving perennial rivers and favorable climate facilitate intense agricultural activity.
	- The extensive use of irrigation has made Punjab, Haryana and western part of Uttar Pradesh the granary of India
