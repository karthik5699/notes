# Left-Wing Extremism

- Introduction
	- **Left Wing Extremism (LWE),** often referred to as **Naxalism**, is one of India's most serious **internal security challenges**. 
	- LWE has historically affected some of the most remote, underdeveloped, and tribal-dominated regions of the country.
- Context
	- Originating from the **Naxalbari movement** of **1967** in **West Bengal**, it spread primarily across the **"Red Corridor,"** affecting states like **Chhattisgarh**, **Jharkhand**, **Odisha**, **Maharashtra**, **Kerala**, **West Bengal**, **Madhya Pradesh**, **Andhra Pradesh** and **Telangana**. 
	- The Maoist insurgents claim to fight for the rights of the marginalized, particularly tribal communities, but their methods include armed violence, extortion, destruction of infrastructure, and recruitment of children and civilians.
	- However, in recent years, India’s **multidimensional counter-LWE strategy** - combining security enforcement, inclusive development, and community engagement - has delivered significant success. 
	- The movement has been **systematically weakened**, **violence** has **drastically declined**, and many LWE-affected districts are being **reintegrated** into the **national mainstream**.
	- The government of India is committed to **completely eliminate Naxalism by 31st March 2026**, since Naxalism is seen as the biggest obstacle in the development of remote areas and tribal villages
- Urban Naxalism
	- Usually it is believed that Naxalite movement grows in the most undeveloped parts of the countries which have no roads, infrastructure etc
	- But Urban Naxalism has always been a part and parcel of the Maoists strategy which uses 'Front Organisations' mainly in urban areas to mobilise certain sections of population
	- Front Organisations are used to recruit intellectual revolutionaries, raise funds for insurgency and create urban shelters.
	- Way forward
		- MHA suggests that the strategy to tackle LWE challenges must include plans to tackle Urban Naxalism
		- A separate budget should be provided to counter the growing Naxal footprints in cities
- Factors responsible for Rise of Naxalism
	- Socio-Economic factors
		- At its core, Naxalism began in rural India (Naxalbari, 1967). Land ownership was highly unequal, zamindari reforms often remained on paper, and landless peasants lived at the mercy of moneylenders and landlords. This create a 'class war'. 
		- Adivasis, Dalits, and forest dwellers—historically excluded from mainstream development—faced displacement (dams, mines, industries) without proper rehabilitation
		- Minerals in Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh are often in tribal areas. Mining projects dispossessed locals, while benefits flowed elsewhere. This economic alienation sharpened grievances.
	- Political Factors
		- The absence of state institutions in remote tribal belts meant people dealt with corrupt contractors, forest officials, and police brutality. In many regions, the state was seen not as a provider but as an oppressor.
		- Local governance (panchayats) was often hijacked by elites; political parties showed little interest in representing the truly marginalized. When ballots didn’t work, bullets gained appeal.
	- Ideological and Global Influences
		- The global wave of Marxist–Leninist and Maoist thought in the 1960s gave intellectual legitimacy to armed revolution
		- Some sections of students, writers, and urban activists glamorised Naxalism as a fight against oppression, giving it cultural and ideological fuel.
- **Government Strategy**
	- The government of India has adopted a **zero-tolerance approach** towards left-wing extremism
	- 2 rules of law
		- First, to **establish** the **rule of law** in Naxalism-affected areas and **completely stop illegal violent activities**
		- Second, to **quickly compensate** for the **loss** in those areas which were deprived of development due to the long Naxalite movement.
	- A **National Policy and Action Plan** to address LWE
		- It envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, development interventions, ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc.
	- Efforts of the Central Government
		- The underlying philosophy is to enhance the capacity of the State governments to tackle the LWE menace in a concerted manner
		- Providing the Central Armed Police Forces
		- Setting up of Counter Insurgency and Anti-Terrorism (CIAT) schools
		- Modernisation and upgradation of the State police and their intelligence apparatus
		- Sharing of intelligence; facilitating inter-state coordination
	- Important schemes for States affected by Left-Wing Extremism
		- Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme:
			- Under the SRE Scheme, the Central Government **reimburses security related expenditure** for LWE affected districts
		- Special Central Assistance (SCA) for most LWE affected districts
			- The main objective of the Scheme is to fill the critical gaps in Public Infrastructure and Services in most LWE affected districts
		- Scheme of Fortified Police stations: 
			- Under the scheme 400 Fortified Police Stations have been constructed in 10 LWE affected States
		- Telecom Connectivity
			- The entire Naxal-affected region will be equipped with mobile connectivity by December 1, 2025.
		- Aspirational District: 
			- The Ministry of Home Affairs has been tasked with the monitoring of Aspirational districts programme in 35 LWE affected districts.
		- Skill Development and Education: 
			- For Skill development several Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Skill Development Centres (SDCs) have been made functional in LWE affected districts.  
			- For quality education in tribal blocks of LWE affected districts 178 Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) have been made functional
	- The government is strengthening **3-C** i.e., **Road connectivity, Mobile connectivity and Financial connectivity** in the LWE affected areas.
- Conclusion
	- With sustained political will, administrative commitment, and people’s participation, the vision of a LWE-free India is closer than ever.
