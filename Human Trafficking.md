# Human Trafficking

- Introduction
	- Human Trafficking, a modern form of slavery, is not only a grave violation of human rights under **Article 23** of the Constitution but also poses a serious non-traditional security threat to India.
	- Human Trafficking is among the largest organised crimes globally in which women and children are the most vulnerable
- Laws
	- Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956
	- Juvenile Justice Act 2015
	- Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act
- Factors
	- Economic Hardship & Poverty
		- Lack of employment, low wages, and the inability to meet basic needs create desperation. 
		- Traffickers exploit this by offering false promises of well-paying jobs, education, or a better life elsewhere.
	- Political Instability & Conflict
		- Refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) often lack legal status, social networks, and resources, making them easy targets for exploitation.
	- Lack of Education & Awareness
		- More likely to believe deceptive offers and less likely to know how to seek help
	- **Gender Inequality:** 
		- In many societies, the devaluation of women and girls makes them disproportionately vulnerable to sex trafficking, forced marriage, and domestic servitude.
	- Weak Governance
		- **Porous Borders:** 
			- Poorly controlled borders make it easier for traffickers to move victims across countries
		- **Inadequate Laws & Enforcement:** 
			- Weak anti-trafficking legislation, coupled with poor enforcement and low conviction rates, means that the potential rewards for traffickers far outweigh the risks.
- Security threats from Human Trafficking:
	- India's geographical location between the **Golden Crescent** and **Golden Triangle**, coupled with porous borders (e.g., Indo-Nepal, Indo-Bangladesh), creates a nexus between human traffickers, drug smugglers, and terrorist networks, which use trafficking routes and proceeds for their operations.
	- It fuels organised crime syndicates involved in forced labour, sexual exploitation, and the organ trade.
- Multi-Pronged Strategy to Combat Trafficking:
	- **Prevention:** 
		- Addressing root causes through socio-economic empowerment schemes like MGNREGA and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, alongside robust awareness campaigns.
	- **Protection:** 
		- Ensuring a victim-centric approach with effective rescue and rehabilitation through schemes like the **Ujjawala Scheme** and providing psychological support
	- **Prosecution:** 
		- Strengthening the legal framework by passing the **Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill**. 
		- This involves empowering **Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs)** for better investigation and ensuring higher conviction rates.
	- **Partnership:** 
		- Enhancing inter-agency coordination domestically and strengthening cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries through treaties and intelligence sharing as per the **UN's Palermo Protocol**.
