# Non-Aligned Movement

The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) emerged in the context of a world grappling with the aftermath of World War II and the burgeoning Cold War, which saw the global division into two hostile blocs led by the United States and the Soviet Union. India's foreign policy, shaped significantly by its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was founded on the principle of non-alignment.

- Objectives and Principles of Non-Alignment
	- Nehru's foreign policy was guided by three major objectives
		- To preserve India's hard-earned sovereignty
		- To protect its territorial integrity
		- To promote rapid economic development
	- He aimed to achieve these objectives through the strategy of non-alignment, which he articulated as having the freedom to decide each issue on its merits, discern right from wrong, and then take a stand in favour of the right.
		- By not tying India to anyone bloc, non-alignment enabled India to develop economic ties with countries on both sides of the divide
	- Nehru constantly emphasized the necessity of peaceful co-existence among countries with different ideologies and systems, believing that no one held a monopoly on truth and that pluralism was a fact of life.
	- In this spirit, Nehru outlined the "Panchsheel" (Five Principles of India's Foreign Policy):
		- Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty
		- Non-aggression
		- Non-interference in each other's internal affairs
		- Equality and mutual benefit
		- Peaceful co-existence
- Emergence and Development of NAM:
	- The Indian national movement itself was part of a broader global struggle against colonialism and imperialism, inspiring liberation movements across Asia and Africa and fostering contacts between their nationalist leaders
	- The Afro-Asian Bandung Conference in 1955 marked the culmination of India's engagement with these newly independent Asian and African nations and subsequently led to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement
- Characteristics and Impact of Non-Alignment:
	- NAM leaders aimed to expand the "area of peace" rather than joining military blocs. India and other non-aligned countries like Egypt and Indonesia refused to join military alliances.
	- Non-alignment symbolized the struggle of newly independent nations to maintain and strengthen their independence from colonialism and imperialism
	- India advocated non-alignment to reduce Cold War tensions and contributed human resources to UN peacekeeping operations
