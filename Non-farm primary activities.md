# Non-farm primary activities

- Introduction
	- Non-farm primary activities refer to the extraction and collection of natural resources that are not part of traditional crop cultivation. 
	- These include mining, quarrying, forestry, fishing, and pastoralism. 
	- The distribution and nature of these activities in India are intrinsically linked to its diverse physiographic features
- How do physiographic features shape them in India?
	- Mountains & Forested Regions
		- Dense forests of the **Himalayas and Western Ghats** → forestry (timber, bamboo, medicinal plants, honey collection).
		- Shifting pastoralism like **Gujjars and Bakarwals** in Kashmir Himalaya or **Gaddis** in Himachal Pradesh
	- Plains
		- Though dominated by farming, non-farm primary activities include **dairying** (Punjab-Haryana milk belt).
		- River systems support **inland fisheries** (Ganga, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi).
	- Arid & Semi-arid Regions
		- **Rajasthan desert** → camel rearing, sheep for wool, gathering of gum & resin
		- Mining of **limestone, gypsum, copper** in Rajasthan.
	- Plateaus
		- Rich in minerals → **coal mining in Jharkhand**, **bauxite in Odisha**, **iron ore in Chhattisgarh**.
		- Forest-based gathering in central India’s tribal areas (tendu leaves, mahua, sal)
	- Coastal areas & islands
		- **Fishing** is dominant: Kerala (marine fisheries), Andhra coast (prawn culture)
		- **Coconut and coir-based gathering** in Kerala and Lakshadweep
- Conclusion
	- The physiographic and geological characteristics of India's diverse regions are the fundamental determinants for the localization of non-farm primary activities
