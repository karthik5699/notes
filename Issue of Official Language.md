# Issue of Official Language

The issue of official language was one of the significant challenges to national consolidation in post-independence India, stemming from the country's vast linguistic diversity.

- The Challenge and Initial Debate
	- The challenges posed by linguistic diversity manifested in two key ways: the dispute over the official language and demands for linguistic reorganization of states
	- The question of Hindi's status as a national language led to conflict between Hindi-speaking and non-Hindi-speaking regions
	- Mahatma Gandhi had opposed the idea of English serving as an all-India medium of communication in free India, viewing it as a foreign language
- Constitutional Provisions and Early Policies
	- The constitution-makers largely resolved the issue by accepting all major languages as "languages of India"
	- The Constitution provided that Hindi in Devanagari script would be India's official language
	- English was stipulated to be used for all official purposes until 1965, with Parliament retaining the power to extend beyond 1965
	- Constitution provided for promotion of Hindi and creation of a **language commission**.
- Recommendations and Implementation Efforts
	- Official Language Commission (1955) recommended replacing English with Hindi in phases.
	- Dissenting members from Bengal & Tamil Nadu accused the report of Hindi bias.
	- 1960 Presidential Order: Hindi to be primary, English to continue as associate language.
- Protests & Amendments
	- Prime Minister Nehru assured that English would continue as an alternate language as long as people required it.
	- The Official Languages Act was passed in 1963 to remove the constitutional restriction on the use of English after 1965
	- However, the Act's use of "may" instead of "shall" for the continuation of English caused ambiguity and attracted criticism.
	- In 1967, the Indira Gandhi government amended the 1963 Official Languages Act. This amendment clarified Nehru's 1959 assurance, stating that English would continue as an associate language for official work at the Centre and communication with non-Hindi states
		- The Act also stipulated that states should adopt a three-language formula.
