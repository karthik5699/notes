## Questions:



# Legacy of British rule in the making of Indian Constitution

- Introduction
	- The making of the Indian Constitution was profoundly shaped by the **legacy of British rule** and the powerful nationalist response against colonial exploitation
- Institutional Continuities and Adaptations
	- The framers of the Indian Constitution did not completely discard the existing institutional frameworks but rather adapted and "indigenized" them within a democratic framework
	- **Parliamentary Procedures**
		- Morley-Minto Reforms (1909) and the Government of India Act, 1919, familiarized Indian political actors with parliamentary procedures, party competition, and representative claims
		- The 1919 reforms, despite their limitations, institutionalized features like **elected legislatures** and the notion of **ministerial responsibility**
	- **Federal Structure**: 
		- The Government of India Act, 1935, while ultimately not fully implemented as a federation, provided a detailed framework for a federal structure. 
		- It introduced a **threefold division of legislative powers** (Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent Lists), a design that significantly inspired our federal arrangements
		- The Indian Constitution's **quasi-federal structure with a strong unitary bias** was partly a consequence of this colonial administrative centralism and the urgent need for national integration following the Partition
	- **Bureaucracy and Civil Services**: 
		- India inherited a professionalized civil service, the Indian Civil Service (ICS), which was characterized by an elitist and authoritarian orientation, primarily serving colonial interests. 
		- While this provided administrative stability, it also reinforced hierarchical and paternalistic governance. 
		- The Constitution retained and adapted this civil services framework, reorienting it towards the goals of nation-building in independent India
	- **Judiciary**: 
		- The existing structure of the judiciary was largely maintained, but it was reoriented to incorporate the principle of judicial review and the robust protection of fundamental rights
- Nationalist Response to Colonial Exploitation
	- **Demand for Rights and Liberties**: 
		- The oppressive nature of colonial laws, such as the Rowlatt Act (1919), the Sedition Laws, highlighted the urgent need for a constitution that guaranteed **fundamental rights** and protected civil liberties. 
		- These commitments were enshrined in Articles 14-32 of the Indian Constitution, fulfilling demands articulated in the 1928 Motilal Nehru Report and the 1931 Karachi Resolution
	- **Economic Justice and State Intervention**: 
		- Nationalist leaders, including Dadabhai Naoroji, heavily criticized British rule for its economic plunder, epitomized by the "drain of wealth" theory. 
		- This critique, combined with socialist and Gandhian ideas, influenced the inclusion of **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs)** in the Constitution to promote economic redistribution, social welfare and rural development
	- **Social Justice and Anti-Discrimination**
		- B.R. Ambedkar's radical critique of caste oppression, a prominent aspect of the nationalist struggle, profoundly shaped the Constitution's commitment to the **abolition of untouchability** (Article 17), the **prohibition of discrimination** (Articles 15-16), and provisions for **affirmative action** (reservations) for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
	- The best summary of the principles that the national movement brought to the Constituent Assembly is the [[Objective Resolution]] moved by Nehru in 1946.
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, the Indian Constitution is a **historical synthesis** that bears the **indelible imprint of colonial legacies**. 
	- It absorbed administrative and institutional blueprints from British rule while simultaneously serving as an instrument for **correcting historical injustices** and fulfilling the aspirations of people.
