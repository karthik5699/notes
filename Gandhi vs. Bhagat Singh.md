1. Highlight the differences in the approach of Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for freedom

# Gandhi vs. Bhagat Singh

- Introduction
	- Both Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi shared a common objective of achieving India’s independence
	- Their approaches sprang from very different _core assumptions_ about how colonial power works and how it should be dismantled.
- Fundamental view of struggle
	- Gandhi believed power lay in moral legitimacy. If the people demonstrated discipline, restraint, and a willingness to suffer without retaliation, they would expose the British as morally bankrupt and force them to quit
	- Bhagat Singh saw colonialism as a brutal material force, not easily swayed by appeals to conscience. In his view, it had to be shaken violently to demonstrate that Indians would not tolerate it.
- Philosophy of action
	- Gandhi: Non-violence (ahimsa) and Satyagraha. He built movements around civil disobedience, boycotts, marches, strikes
	- **Bhagat Singh:** Revolutionary socialism and armed resistance. He focused on _symbolic violence_ — targeted actions like the Assembly bombing (designed to make noise, not kill) — as a means of awakening political consciousness, especially among youth
- Time horizon
	- **Gandhi:** Long game. He thought a morally uplifted, self-reliant society was _a precondition_ for true freedom, so political independence could wait until that groundwork was laid
	- **Bhagat Singh:** Urgent game. He believed the system needed to be disrupted now to open space for larger structural change, including ending exploitation of workers and peasants.
- Mass mobilisation vs Vanguardism
	- **Gandhi:** Mobilise _everyone_ — peasants, workers, women — and keep the bar to entry low by avoiding violence.
	- **Bhagat Singh:** Inspire a _committed vanguard_ of politically conscious youth, who could in turn ignite the masses through bold actions.
- Type of Society
	- Gandhi: Advocated village-based economy (Gram Swaraj) emphasizing self-sufficiency
	- Bhagat Singh: Envisioned a socialist republic with economic equality; supported industrialization and scientific temper
- Conclusion
	- These complementary approaches reflect how their different methods worked together in the freedom struggle, jointly weakening British colonial authority by exerting pressure on multiple fronts.
