# India's Energy Strategy

![[Pasted image 20250620224049.png]]

India's energy strategy is deeply intertwined with its ambition to achieve developed nation status by 2047 and its commitment to inclusive and sustainable development, while simultaneously addressing climate change.

The country aims for low-carbon economic growth, which presents significant challenges and trade-offs.

Comprehensive overview of India's energy strategy:
- Vision and Objectives
	- India's ambition is to achieve developed nation status by 2047, which is fundamentally anchored in inclusive and sustainable development
	- The country is committed to pursuing low-carbon growth despite having per capita carbon emissions that are one-third of the global average
	- A key goal is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2070
	- The strategy aims to ensure affordable energy security, job creation, economic growth, and environmental sustainability
- Current Energy Landscape and Challenges
	- Dominance of Coal: 
		- Coal has an important role to play in India’s sustainable development
		- India's energy mix is currently dominated by coal, accounting for 60% of its primary energy consumption. 
		- Most of India's coal-fired power plants were built in the 2010s, unlike developed countries where they were built much earlier
		- There is no valid economic rationale for shutting down coal plants in India, leaving huge investments underutilised and stranded and without a dependable alternative in place.
		- India's only reliable energy source is coal as it possesses around 10 per cent of the world's coal reserves but only 0.7 per cent of the world’s natural gas
	- Import Dependence
		- India imports most of its oil
		- India has low production capacity in the solar energy sector for key components like polysilicon, ingots, and wafers; heavily relying on Chinese supply chains
		- Manufacturing electric vehicles also requires significantly more minerals, many of which are scarcely available or processed in India, leading to supply disruption risks
	- Technological Gaps: 
		- Challenges in effectively harnessing and scaling renewable energy resources are due to the lack of viable storage technologies and limited access to essential minerals
		- One of the key pillars of SDG7 is the expansion of renewable energy; however, it is clear that even in the most advanced economies, the technologies for renewable energy and their implementation are not yet at a maturity level that allows them to fully replace fossil fuel-based power plants.
	- Grid Integration and Intermittency: 
		- Integrating renewable energy efficiently into the energy mix is hindered by significant investments needed for grid integration and the development of battery infrastructure to manage intermittency
	- Financial and Regulatory Issues: 
		- High energy costs
			- In many Indian states, factories have to pay **much more** for electricity than it actually costs to produce. This extra charge (called a _markup_) can be as high as **10–25%**.
		- Discom (power distribution companies) financial health issues, and 
		- Inconsistencies in tariffs affect the sector
			- Different states in India charge different electricity prices, and sometimes even within the same state, prices vary for different users (like homes, farms, or factories)
- Strategic Pillars and Measures
	- Renewable Energy and Energy Transition:
		- India has reached its goal of 50% electric capacity from non-fossil-based sources in 2025 itself, the target it set for 2030
	- Panchamrit Targets: 
		- The Panchamrit targets, announced at COP 26 in Glasgow, outline India's ambitious climate action goals to be achieved by 2030
			- Reach a non-fossil fuel energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030
			- Fulfil at least 50% of energy requirements via renewable energy by 2030.
			- Reduce CO2 emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030.
			- Reduce carbon intensity below 45% by 2030.
			- Achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2070.
	- PM - Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana: 
		- Aims to install rooftop solar plants in one crore households by 2027
		- **Objectives:**
			- Provide financial incentives and subsidies for solar panel installation
			- Enable households to **generate** their **own electricity**, reducing dependency on the grid.
			- Reduce electricity bills by allowing households to generate and sell surplus solar energy to the grid.
	- Green Energy Corridor (GEC)
		- Aims to establish an intra-state transmission system that enhances grid capabilities for renewable energy.
	- National Bioenergy Programme 
		- **Waste to Energy** – Turns garbage and other waste into electricity
		- **Biomass Programme** – Helps make fuel blocks (like pellets) and supports using crop waste (not sugarcane waste) to make energy in factories
		- **Biogas Programme** – Supports making gas from things like cow dung and kitchen waste for cooking or power (SATAT initiative)
	- Solar Parks and Ultra-mega Solar Power Projects 
		- sets a target for establishing 40,000 megawatts of capacity
	- PM-KUSUM
		- Scheme supports farmers by **offering financial assistance** for installing **solar-powered irrigation systems**, including solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plant
	- **National Green Hydrogen Mission**
		- With **over Rs. 8 lakh crores** in total investments, green hydrogen capacity is expected to reach **5 million metric tons by 2030**. 
		- Objectives
			- Making India a **leading producer** and **supplier** of Green Hydrogen in the world
			- Development of **indigenous** manufacturing capabilities
	- Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
		- Aims to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities in key sectors, including solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage, by offering incentives to domestic manufacturers.
	- Role of Coal
		- Coal cannot be neglected as a reliable and affordable energy source given India's resource endowments
		- Promotion of efficient use of coal through technologies like Super-Critical (SC), Ultra-Super-Critical (USC), and Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) power plants.
	- Nuclear Energy:
		- Nuclear energy has significance due to its higher efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions
	- Oil and Gas:
		- India is the third largest oil consumer & fourth largest refiner globally
		- Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP): Introduced open acreages and a revenue-sharing model to promote exploration and production
		- Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY): 
			- Aims to provide deposit-free LPG connections to women from BPL households
	- Energy Efficiency
		- The Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) Mission encourages sustainable practices and a circular economy to reduce resource consumption
		- Initiatives include the Eco-mark scheme, star-labelling scheme, and 'Go Electric' campaign raise awareness about energy efficiency and electromobility
		
Energy is not just a commodity. It is a catalyst for sovereignty, security and sustainable development.
