## Questions:

1. Examine the role of Vedic and post-Vedic texts in shaping early Indian scientific thought. How can they be made accessible to todayâ€™s learners? (10 M)

# Vedic Age Literature (1500-500 BCE)

The word "Veda" originates from the root vid, meaning 'to know', and translates to 'knowledge'. There are four Vedas:

- Rig Veda
	- Contains 1,028 hymns (suktas) arranged in 10 books (Mandalas). 
	- Its hymns are considered the world's oldest surviving poetry, some possessing extraordinary beauty and philosophical depth
	- Recently, the Rig Veda has been included by the UNESCO in the list of literature signifying World Human Heritage
- Sama Veda
	- Collection of verses, mostly borrowed from the Rig Veda, arranged for musical notation
- Yajur Veda
	- Focuses on the details of performing sacrificial rituals (yajnas)
	- Its texts are divided into Shukla (White) and Krishna (Black) schools
- Atharva Veda: 
	- The latest Veda, containing hymns along with spells and charms

Each Veda typically has four parts, which sometimes blend into each other:
- Samhita: 
	- Collections of hymns or prayers
- Brahmana: 
	- Prose explanations of the Samhita portions, detailing and explaining sacrificial rituals and their outcomes.
- Aranyaka ('forest books'): 
	- Interpret sacrificial rituals in a symbolic and philosophical way
- Upanishad: 
	- Contain a variety of philosophical ideas, most closely associated with the concepts of atman (self) and brahman (ultimate reality).
	- The Mandukyopanishad 'Satyameva Jayate' is the largest of all Upanishads

There are also Vedanga (literally, 'limbs of a Veda'), which are supplementary texts aimed at aiding the proper recitation, use, and understanding of the Vedas. These include works on phonetics (shiksha), metre (chhanda), grammar (vyakarana), etymology (nirukta), ritual (kalpa), and astronomy (jyotisha)

Role in shaping early scientific thought
- Mathematics & Astronomy
	- these texts contain sophisticated knowledge of the solar system
	- estimated Earth's circumference and deducted the value of Pi
	- accurately predicted celestial events like eclipses
- Medicine
	- Charaka - systematised Ayurveda
	- Sushruta Samhita - detailing anatomy, surgery, pharmacology
- Linguistics & Logic
	- Panini's Ashtadhyayi - scientific grammar of Sanskrit, considered a precursor to formal systems and algorithms

Varied Aspects of Vedic Culture
- Society
	- The four-fold varna order (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) is first explicitly mentioned in the Purusha-sukta of Rig Veda Book 10
	- This system defined social boundaries, roles, status, and ritual purity.
	- There was social mobility as person could change their varna status by changing their profession
	- In the Rig Vedic age, women had important positions in the society and they were free to choose their life partner
	- Largely there were joint families in the Vedic age, which followed the patrilineal system
