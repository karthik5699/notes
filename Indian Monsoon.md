# Indian Monsoon

- Introduction
	- Monsoons are seasonal winds which reverse their direction with the change of season.
	- They are a double system of seasonal winds — they flow from sea to land during the summer (south-west monsoon winds) and from land to sea during winter (north-east monsoon winds).
	- Monsoons are peculiar to the Indian Subcontinent, South East Asia, parts of Central Western Africa, etc.
	- India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, etc., receive most of the annual rainfall during the south-west monsoon season, whereas South East China, Japan, etc., during the north-east rainfall season.
- Influencing Factors
	- Factors responsible for south-west monsoon formation
		- Intense heating of the Tibetan Plateau during summer months.
		- Permanent high-pressure cell (Mascarene High) in the South Indian Ocean
	- Factors that influence the onset of south-west monsoons
		- Above points +
		- Subtropical Jet Stream (STJ)
		- Tropical Easterly Jet (African Easterly Jet)
		- Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)
	- Factors that influence the intensity of south-west monsoons
		- Strengths of Low pressure over Tibet and high pressure over the southern Indian Ocean
		- Somali Jet
		- Somali Current
		- Indian Ocean branch of Walker Cell
		- Indian Ocean Dipole
	- Factors responsible for north-east monsoon formation
		- Formation and strengthening of high-pressure cells over the Tibetan Plateau and Siberian Plateau in winter.
		- Westward migration and subsequent weakening of high-pressure cell (Mascarene High) in the Southern Indian Ocean.
		- Migration of ITCZ to the south of India.
	- Indian monsoon has been changing due to humanizing landscapes
		- Urbanization & Heat Islands
			- Cities are hotter, locally intensifying convection and rainfall
			- Instead of gradual heating and uniform rainfall, you get short, intense cloudbursts.
		- Deforestation
			- Forests recycle moisture through transpiration. 
			- Cutting them reduces local humidity and weakens rainfall feedback loops
			- **Amazon rainforest**: Called the “flying river,” because up to half its rain is recycled locally by trees.
		- Irrigation & Cropping Patterns
			- Huge irrigated areas (like Indo-Gangetic plains) change the “thermal profile” of the land. 
			- Instead of heating strongly in May–June, the land stays cooler and wetter → delaying monsoon onset or modifying intensity.
- Mechanism of Indian Monsoons – Classical Theory
	- The origin of monsoons is not fully understood. Several theories tried to explain the mechanism
	- In the seventeenth century, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Sir Edmund Halley</mark> explained the monsoon as resulting from thermal contrasts between continents and oceans due to their differential heating. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250804160424.png]]
	- This theory considers Indian Monsoons as Land and Sea Breeze on a large scale
	- Summer Monsoon
		- ![[Pasted image 20250804160507.png]]
		- In summer, the sun’s apparent path is vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, resulting in high temperatures and low pressure in Central Asia.
		- The pressure is sufficiently high over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Hence, winds from the ocean flow towards the landmass in summer. 
		- This airflow from sea to land brings heavy rainfall to the Indian subcontinent.
	- Winter Monsoon
		- ![[Pasted image 20250804160701.png]]
		- In winter, the sun’s apparent path is vertically over the Tropic of Capricorn. The northwestern part of India grows colder than the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and the flow of the monsoon is reversed.
	- Drawbacks of Sir Edmund Halley’s Theory
		- The monsoons do not develop equally everywhere on earth, and the thermal concept of Halley fails to explain the intricacies of the monsoons, such as the sudden burst of monsoons, delay in the onset of monsoons sometimes, etc
		- With the development of other significant factors that influence monsoons, Halley’s theory lost its relevance.
- Mechanism of Indian Monsoons – Based on Modern Theories
	- Besides differential heating, the development of monsoons is influenced by the shape of the continents, orography (mountains), and the conditions of air circulation in the upper troposphere (jet streams).
	- Indian Monsoon Mechanism -- Seasonal Rhythm
		- March to May
			- ![[Pasted image 20250804161431.png]]
			- As the summertime approaches, there is increased solar heating of the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau.
			- The Subtropical High-Pressure Belt occupies northwest India and the Plains region. This high-pressure belt undermines the influence of low-pressure cells over Tibet.
			- From March to May, the building up of the monsoon cell is blocked by the Subtropical Jet Stream (STJ), which tends to blow to the south of the Himalayas.
			- As long as the STJ is in this position, the development of summer monsoons is inhibited
		- Between Late May and Early June
			- ![[Pasted image 20250804161712.png]]
			- In the peak summer months (25th of May – 10th of June), with the apparent northward movement of the sun, the southern branch of the Sub-Tropical Jet stream (STJ), which flows to the south of the Himalayas, shifts to the north of the Himalayas.
			- When the sun’s position is about to reach the Tropic of Cancer (June), the STJ shifts to the north of the Tibetan Plateau (1st of Jun – 20th of June). 
			- The ITCZ is close to its peak position over the Tibetan Plateau.
			- The altitude of the mountains initially disrupts the jet, but once it has cleared the summits, it is able to reform over central Asia. Its movement towards the north is one of the main features associated with the onset of the monsoon over India.
		- The onset of Monsoons (1st or 2nd week of June)
			- With the northward shift of STJ, an Easterly Jet is formed over the Indian plains. It generally forms in the first week of June and lasts till late October. It can be traced in the upper troposphere right up to the west coast of Africa.
			- The northward shift of STJ and ICTZ moves the subtropical high-pressure belt to the north of the Tibetan Plateau, and the Easterly Jet creates a low-pressure region in the Indian plains
			- With the STJ out of the way (the high-pressure belt migrates to the north of Tibet), the subcontinental monsoon cell develops very quickly, often in a matter of a few days.
			- The low pressure in the northern plains coupled with the intense low of the Tibetan Plateau leads to the sudden onset of south-west monsoon winds 
		- Rainy season
			- ![[Pasted image 20250804173356.png]]
			- The sub-tropical easterly jet fluctuates between the plains region of India and peninsular India, varying the intensity of rainfall from location to location.
			- Warmth and moisture are fed into the cell by a lower-level tropical jet stream (Somali Jet), which brings with it air masses laden with moisture from the Indian Ocean.
		- The end of the Monsoon season
			- The end of the monsoon season is brought about when the atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau begins to cool (August – October). This enables the STJ to transition back across the Himalayas.
			- With the southward shift of ITCZ, the subtropical high-pressure belt returns to the Indian plains, and the rainfall ceases.
			- This leads to the formation of an anticyclonic winter monsoon cell typified by sinking air masses over India and relatively moisture-free winds that blow seaward.
			- This gives rise to relatively settled and dry weather over India during the winter months
	- Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Air Mass Theory
		- According to this theory, the monsoon is simply a modification of the planetary winds of the tropics. 
		- The theory is based on the migration of ITCZ based on seasons.
		- This theory suggests that the monsoon winds during the south-west monsoon season are simply the expanded equatorial westerlies which lie embedded in the great mass of tropical easterlies or the trade winds.
		- Role of ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone)
			- The south-east trade winds in the southern hemisphere and the north-east trade winds in the northern hemisphere meet each other near the equator. 
			- The meeting place of these winds is known as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).
			- ITCZ is the region of ascending air, maximum clouds, and heavy rainfall. 
			- Its location shifts north and south of the equator with the change of season.
			- In the summer season, the sun shines vertically over the Tropic of Cancer, and the ITCZ shifts north- wards.
			- The south-east trade winds of the southern hemisphere cross the equator and start blowing in the south-west to a north-east direction under the influence of Coriolis force. 
			- These displaced trade winds are called south-west monsoons when they blow over the Indian sub-continent.
			- The front where the south-west monsoons meet the north-east trade winds is known as the Monsoon Front (ITCZ). Rainfall occurs along this front.
	- Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Modern Theory: Jet Stream Theory
		- ![[Pasted image 20250804175410.png]]
		- Jet streams have distinct peaks (ridges) and troughs. Ridges occur when the warm air mass pushes against the cold air mass. Troughs occur when cold air mass drops into warm air.
		- The region on earth below the trough is at low pressure, and the region below the ridge is at high pressure. This condition occurs due to the weakening of the jet stream due to lesser temperature contrast between sub-tropics and temperate regions 
		- These ridges and troughs give rise to jet streaks, which are also responsible for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather conditions at the surface.
		- Jet Streaks and Cyclonic Conditions
			- Jet streaks = zones of intense upper-level divergence or convergence
			- The winds leaving the jet streak are rapidly diverging (anticyclonic), creating a lower pressure at the upper level (Tropopause) in the atmosphere.
			- The air below rapidly replaces the upper outflowing winds. This, in turn, creates the low pressure at the surface. 
			- This surface low pressure creates conditions where the surrounding surface winds rush inwards. 
			- The Coriolis effect creates the cyclonic rotation (cyclonic vortex) that is associated with depressions (low-pressure cells).
			- When a jet streak passes over a region, it can enhance the development of surface low-pressure systems by increasing convergence and lift in the atmosphere. 
			- This can lead to the formation of cyclones or areas of stormy weather.
		- Jet Streaks and Anticyclonic Conditions
			- The winds entering the jet streak are rapidly converging because of the high pressure at the upper level (Tropopause) in the atmosphere. 
			- This convergence at the upper troposphere leads to divergence (high pressure) at the surface (anticyclonic condition).
			- The Coriolis effect creates the anticyclonic rotation that is associated with clear weather.
		- These mechanisms of the Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ) influence the Indian Monsoons by shifting the pressure cells.
	- Indian Monsoon Mechanism – Role of Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ)
		- Sub-tropical jet stream plays a significant role in both hindering the monsoon winds and in the quick onset of monsoons.
		- The sub-tropical Jet stream is a narrow band of fast-moving air flowing from west to east (Westerlies).
		- In winter, STJ flows along the southern slopes of the Himalayas. In summer, it shifts northwards rather dramatically and flows along the northern edge of the Himalayas in early June
		- The periodic movement of the Jet stream is often the indicator of the onset and subsequent withdrawal of the monsoon.
		- Northward movement of the subtropical jet is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India
		- Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ) in Winter
			- STJ blows at a very high speed during winter over the sub-tropical zone. It is bifurcated by the Himalayan ranges.
			- The northern branch of this jet stream blows along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The southern branch blows to the south of the Himalayan ranges.
			- The southern branch is stronger.
			- Air subsiding beneath this upper westerly current gives dry, out-blowing northerly winds from the subtropical anticyclone over north-western India and Pakistan.
		- Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ) in Summer
			- With the beginning of summer in March, the STJ (upper westerlies) starts its northward march
			- The weather over northern India becomes hot, dry, and squally due to larger incoming solar radiation and hot winds like the loo.
			- By the end of May, the southern jet breaks, and later, it is diverted to the north of the Tibet Plateau. There is a sudden burst of monsoons.
			- An Easterly jet emerges over peninsular India with the northward migration of STJ. 
			- The easterly winds become very active in the upper troposphere, and they are associated with westerly winds in the lower troposphere (south-west monsoon winds).
		- Why are there no south-west monsoons in March-May (summer)?
			- There is good insolation from March-May, but still, there are no south-west monsoons.
			- The ridge region of the Southern branch of STJ creates strong divergence (high pressure) in north-west India. The diverging air blocks incoming winds and prevents strong convergence of winds along ITCZ.
			- As long as the position of the upper air jet stream is maintained, the dynamic anticyclonic conditions persist over north-west India.
			- The winds descending from the upper air high pressure (because of the ridge of STJ) obstruct the ascent of winds from the surface low-pressure areas, resulting in warm and dry weather.
			- This is why the months of April and May are generally dry and rainless in spite of high temperatures and high evaporation
- Indian Monsoons – Influencing Factors
	- Indian Monsoons – Role of Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) (African Easterly Jet)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250804161712.png]]
		- The TEJ plays an important role in kick-starting the south-west monsoon. This jet descends over the Indian Ocean (near Madagascar) and intensifies its high-pressure cell, aiding the south- west monsoon winds.
	- Indian Monsoons – Role of Tibet
		- The Tibetan Plateau is an enormous block of highland, acting as a formidable barrier. 
		- Because the Tibet Plateau is a source of heat for the atmosphere, it generates an area of rising air (convergence)
		- During its ascent, the air spreads outwards in the upper troposphere (divergence) and gradually sinks (subsidence) over the equatorial part of the Indian Ocean (monsoon cell).
		- In winter, the Tibetan Plateau cools rapidly and produces a high-pressure cell. (Cyclonic condition over Tibet ceases, and an anticyclonic condition is established). This high-pressure cell over Tibet strengthens N-E monsoons.
	- Indian Monsoons – Role of Somali Jet
		- The progress of the south-west monsoon towards India is greatly aided by the onset of the Somali jet that transits Kenya, Somalia, and the Sahel.
		- The current in the Arabian Sea associated with the Somali Jet is called the Findlater Current. The monsoon winds influence its direction. It reverses its direction with the monsoon winds.
		- Findlater Current in the south-west monsoon season creates a zone of coastal upwelling near the horn of Africa (good for fishing).
	- Indian Monsoons – Role of Indian Ocean Dipole
		- ![[Pasted image 20250804200002.png]]
		- Indian Ocean Dipole is a recently discovered phenomenon that has a significant influence on Indian monsoons. 
		- It is a Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Anomaly that occurs occasionally in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR)
		- The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between two areas (or poles, hence a dipole) — a western pole in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean) and an eastern pole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of Indonesia
		- With positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from the Bay of Bengal towards the Arabian Sea). 
		- This results in the Arabian Sea being much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry.
		- In the negative dipole year, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.
		- Positive IOD is good for Indian Monsoons as more evaporation occurs in warm water.
- Characteristics of the Indian Monsoon
	- Monsoon rainfall is a vital component of India's climate, as it plays a crucial role in determining agricultural productivity, water resources, and overall socio-economic development.
	- Seasonal Reversal
	- Variability
		- Different regions experience varying amounts of rainfall, with some areas receiving abundant precipitation while others face drought-like conditions
		- High Rainfall: Western Ghats, north-east India, Meghalaya
		- Moderate Rainfall: Central India, Gangetic plains
		- Low Rainfall: Western Rajasthan, Ladakh
	- Long Period Average
		- India Meteorological Department (IMD) brands the monsoon as ‘normal’ or ‘deficient’ based on how it fares against its benchmark Long Period Average (LPA).
		- LPA is the average rainfall received by the country as a whole during the south-west monsoon, for a 50-year period.
	- Monsoon Break
		- The monsoon trough is the elongated low-pressure area over the Indian subcontinent formed by the northward shifting of ITCZ. It serves as a focal point for the convergence of moisture-laden winds, leading to widespread rainfall.
		- The position and intensity of the monsoon trough influence the distribution of rainfall across different parts of India. When the monsoon trough shifts northward, it brings rainfall to the northern plains and parts of central India.
		- Monsoon break occurs when the monsoon trough shifts northward to the Himalayan foothills. This enhances rainfall in the Himalayan states, while for the rest of India, rainfall is suppressed or temporarily interrupted.
		- Factors that Can Cause Monsoon Break
			- El Nino Event
			- Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
			- Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
	- Impact on Agriculture
		- Monsoon rainfall is critical for agriculture in India, as the majority of the country's farmland is rain-fed. 
		- Adequate monsoon rains ensure optimal soil fertility
		- Deficient monsoon rainfall can lead to droughts, crop failures, and food shortages, affecting millions of farmers and rural communities.
