# Cotton Industry

- Introduction
	- India, with its tropical climate and abundant cotton crop, became a significant centre for fine cotton cloth production.
	- India is the 2nd largest producer of cotton, but became a net importer of cotton recently.
- Cotton Cultivation: Key Requirements
	- Temperature: 20-28 ºc
	- Rainfall: 55-110cm
	- Deep, well-drained soil (preferably black soil)
	- Requires a frost-free period of 180-200 days
- Geographical Distribution
	- Initially concentrated in Mumbai, the Maharashtra, and Gujarat.
- Factors Affecting location of Cotton Industry
	- Raw Material
		- Industry location traditionally aligned with cotton-growing areas like Ahmedabad, Nagpur, and Coimbatore
	- Transportation: 
		- Ideal locations are well-connected to both cotton-producing regions and markets to minimize transport costs
	- Power supply:
		- The first mills rose in Mumbai because coal (from nearby areas) and later electricity could power machines.
		- Modern mills spread where reliable power grids exist
	- Water availability:
		- Textile processing (bleaching, dyeing, printing) guzzles water. 
		- Cities with rivers or coastlines (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore) became hubs
	- Climate: 
		- Coastal regions with tropical/subtropical climates are favoured 
	- Labour
		- Textile mills are labour-intensive. 
		- Surplus rural population in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and later northern states provided cheap labour
- Challenges Facing the Industry
	- Raw material issues:
		- Cotton production is highly **monsoon-dependent** → irregular supply.
		- Cotton yield in India at 430 kg/ha is very low compared to Brazil and China
	- Outdated technology:
		- Many spinning and weaving units still use old machinery
		- Powerlooms dominate, but modern automatic looms are fewer compared to China or Bangladesh.
	- Power shortages & costs:
		- Unreliable electricity and high power tariffs raise costs for mills.
	- Labour challenges:
		- Though labour is abundant, it is often unskilled for modern machinery.
	- Global Competition: 
		- Facing competition from cheaper and higher-quality textile goods from countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan
	- Fragmentation of industry:
		- Too many small, scattered units (handlooms, powerlooms, small mills) → lack economies of scale.
		- Integration from fibre to finished product is weak.
- Government Initiatives
	- Cott-Ally Mobile App: 
		- Assists cotton farmers by providing information on MSP, procurement centres, payments, and best farming practices.
	- Mega Investment Textiles Parks (MITRA): 
		- Establishes seven textile parks to boost industry competitiveness and attract investments
	- Removal of 11% import duty on cotton (Sep 15th, 2025)
		- Good for firms, bad for farmers
