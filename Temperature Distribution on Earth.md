# Temperature Distribution on Earth

- Sun is the ultimate source of heat. And the differential heat received from sun by different regions on earth is the ultimate reason behind all climatic features. 
- So understanding the patterns of distribution of temperature in different seasons is important for understanding various climatic features like wind systems, pressure systems, precipitation etc.

Insolation
- Earth intercepts only one in two billion parts of solar radiation. This intercepted radiation is called Insolation
- Earth receives Sun’s radiation (heat) in the form of short waves (visible light + wavelengths below visible light – most of it is ultraviolet radiation) which are of electromagnetic nature.
- The earth absorbs short wave radiation during daytime and reflects back the heat received into space as long-wave radiation (mostly infrared radiation) during night.

####  Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution
- The Angle of Incidence or the Inclination of the Sun’s Rays
- Duration of Sunshine
	- Heat received depends on day or night; clear sky or overcast, summer or winter etc..
- Transparency of Atmosphere
	- Aerosols (smoke, sooth), dust, water vapour, clouds etc. effect transparency
	- If the wavelength (X) of the radiation is more than the radius of the obstructing particle (such as a gas), then scattering of radiation takes place
	- If the wavelength is less than the obstructing particle (such as a dust particle), then total reflection takes place
	- Absorption of solar radiation takes place if the obstructing particles happen to be water vapour, ozone molecules, carbon dioxide molecules or clouds
- Land-Sea Differential
	- Albedo of land is much greater than albedo of oceans and water bodies. 
		- Especially snow covered areas reflect up to 70%-90% of insolation.
	- Average penetration of sunlight is more in water – up to 20 metres, than in land – where it is up to 1 metre only. 
		- Therefore, land cools or becomes hot more rapidly compared to oceans. 
		- In oceans, continuous convection cycle helps in heat exchange between layers keeping diurnal and annual temperature ranges low.
	- The specific heat of water is 2.5 times higher than landmass, therefore water takes longer to get heated up and to cool down
- Prevailing Winds
	- Winds transfer heat from one latitude to another. They also help in exchange of heat between land and water bodies
	- The oceanic winds have the capacity to take the moderating influence of the sea to coastal areas – reflected in cool summers and mild winters.
- Ocean Currents
	- Ocean currents influence the temperature of adjacent land areas considerably
- Altitude
	- With increase in height, pressure falls, the effect of greenhouse gases decreases and hence temperature decreases


#### Latitudinal Heat Balance
- The amount of insolation received varies from latitude to latitude
- ![[Pasted image 20250704162221.png]]
- Regions within the equator and 40° N and S latitudes receive abundant sunlight and hence more heat will be gained than lost. 
	- Hence they are energy surplus regions
- Regions beyond 40° N and S latitudes lose more heat than that gained from sunlight. 
	- Hence they are energy deficit regions
- Going by this logic, the tropics should have been getting progressively hotter and the poles getting progressively cooler. And the planet would have been inhospitable except for few regions near mid-latitudes. But, in reality, this does not happen.
- The atmosphere (<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">planetary winds</mark>) and the oceans (<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">ocean currents</mark>) transfer excess heat from the tropics (energy surplus region) towards the poles (energy deficit regions) making up for heat loss at higher latitudes
- And most of the heat transfer takes place across the mid-latitudes (30° to 50°) and hence much of the stormy weather is associated with this region


### Heat Budget
- The earth receives a certain amount of Insolation (short waves) and gives back heat into space by terrestrial radiation (long wave radiation). Through this give and take, or the heat budget, the earth maintains a constant temperature

#### The Mean Annual Temperature Distribution
- **Isotherm** == An imaginary line joining places having equal temperatures
- The horizontal or latitudinal distribution of temperature is shown with the help of a map with isotherms
- Effects of altitude is not considered while drawing an isotherm. All the temperatures are reduced to sea levels
- General characteristics of isotherms
	- **Generally follow the parallels**: 
		- Isotherms have close correspondence with the latitude parallels mainly because the same amount of insolation is received by all the points located on the same latitude
	- Sudden bends at ocean – continent boundaries: 
		- Due to differential heating of land and water, temperatures above the oceans and landmasses vary even on the same latitude
	- **Narrow spacing** between isotherms indicate **rapid change** in temperature (high thermal gradient).
	- **Wide spacing** between isotherms indicate **small or slow change** in temperatures (low thermal gradient).

#### General Temperature Distribution
- The highest temperatures occur over tropics and sub-tropics (high insolation). The lowest temperatures occur in polar and sub polar regions.
- Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are highest in the interiors of continents due to the effect of continentiality (in continental interiors these will no moderating effect of oceans)
- Diurnal and annual range of temperatures are least in oceans
- Low temperature gradients are observed over tropics (sun is almost overhead the entire year) and high temperature gradients over middle and higher latitudes (sun’s apparent path varies significantly from season to season)
	- Temperature gradient measures how quickly temperature changes from one place to another over a certain distance
- Temperature gradients are usually low over the eastern margins of continents. (This is because of **warm ocean currents**)
- Temperature gradients are usually high over the western margins of continents. (This is because of **cold ocean currents**)
- The isotherms are irregular over the northern hemisphere due to an **enhanced land-sea contrast.** 
	- Because of predominance of land over water in the north, the **northern hemisphere is warmer**. 
	- The thermal equator (ITCZ) lies generally to the north of geographical equator.
- While passing through an area with warm ocean currents, the isotherms show a poleward shift.
- Mountains also affect the horizontal distribution of temperature. For instance, the Rockies and the Andes stop the oceanic influence from going inwards into North and South America.


#### Seasonal Temperature Distribution
- The global distribution of temperature can well be understood by studying the temperature distribution in January and July
- In general the effect of the latitude on temperature is well pronounced on the map, as the isotherms are generally parallel to the latitude. The deviation from this general trend is more pronounced in January than in July, especially in the northern hemisphere.
- In the northern hemisphere the land surface area is much larger than in the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects of land mass and the ocean currents are well pronounced

##### Seasonal Temperature Distribution – January
- ![[Pasted image 20250704170506.png]]
- During January, it is winter in the northern hemisphere and summer in the southern hemisphere.
- The western margins of continents are warmer than their eastern counterparts, since the Westerlies are able to carry high temperature into the landmasses
- The temperature gradient is close to the eastern margins of continents. The isotherms exhibit a more regular behavior in the southern hemisphere
- Northern Hemisphere
	- The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent. This can be seen on the North Atlantic Ocean.
	- The presence of warm ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic drift, make the Northern Atlantic Ocean warmer and the isotherms show a poleward shift indicating that the oceans are warmer
	- An equator ward bend of the isotherms over the northern continents shows that the landmasses are overcooled and that polar cold winds are able to penetrate southwards, even in the interiors. It is much pronounced in the Siberian plain
- Southern Hemisphere
	- The effect of the ocean is well pronounced in the southern hemisphere. Here the isotherms are more or less parallel to the latitudes and the variation in temperature is more gradual than in the northern hemisphere.
	- The thermal equator lies to the south of geographical equator (because the Intertropical Convergence Zone or ITCZ has shifted southwards with the apparent southward movement of the sun).
##### Seasonal Temperature Distribution – July
- ![[Pasted image 20250704171428.png]]
- During July, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere. The isothermal behavior is the opposite of what it is in January.
- In July the isotherms generally run parallel to the latitudes
- Northern Hemisphere
	- Over the northern continents, a poleward bend of the isotherms indicates that the landmasses are overheated and the hot tropical winds are able to go far into the northern interiors.
	- The isotherms over the northern oceans show an equator ward shift indicating that the oceans are cooler and are able to carry the moderating effect into tropical interiors
	- The temperature gradient is irregular and follows a zig-zag path over the northern hemisphere.
- Southern Hemisphere
	- The gradient becomes regular over the southern hemisphere but shows a slight bend towards the equator at the edges of continents. 
	- Thermal equator now lies to the north of the geographical equator.
