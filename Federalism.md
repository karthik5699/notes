# Federalism

- Introduction
	- Federalism is an institutional mechanism to accommodate two sets of polities--one at the regional level and the other at the national level
	- This structural division aims to reconcile national unity with regional autonomy
- Indian Federalism: A Quasi-Federal System
	- India's constitutional design establishes a quasi-federal system combining a strong central authority with autonomous state governments. 
	- This framework was influenced by colonial administrative centralism and the need for national integration after Partition
	- Evolution and Dynamics of Indian Federalism
		- One-Party Dominance (1950s–1967): 
			- During the initial decades, the Congress Party's dominance at both Centre and most states led to "centralized federalism" 
			- Federalism operated through intra-party consultation, with Chief Ministers often dependent on the Prime Minister. 
			- This period saw the centralization of planning and a unitary ethos under national development
		- The Federal Turn: Regional Assertion and Political Fragmentation (1967-1989)
			- The 1967 elections marked a turning point with Congress losing power in several states and the emergence of non-Congress regional parties. 
			- Centre-State tensions escalated over language policy, revenue sharing, and autonomy. 
			- The Central government frequently invoked Article 356 (President's Rule) for partisan reasons
			- Several states made their own recommendations for restructuring centre-state relations
				- Tamil Nadu --> Rajamannar Committee (1971)
				- Punjab --> Anandpur Sahib Resolution (1973)
		- Coalition Era & Negotiated Federalism (1989–2014): 
			- The decline of Congress dominance and the rise of coalition politics significantly altered dynamics. 
			- Regional parties gained leverage at the Centre, leading to "negotiated federalism" that increased their fiscal and political bargaining power
			- S.R. Bommai case (1994) declared federalism as the basic structure of Indian Constitution, creating an immunity for the state governments against the arbitrary use of Article 356
			- Post-LPG reforms, states started attracting foreign investments thereby reducing their dependence on union government.
		- Post-2014 Return of Dominant Party Federalism: 
			- With a single-party majority, India witnessed a reassertion of central control, often termed "executive federalism"  
			- This involved centralized decision-making through schemes, allegations of fiscal centralization (e.g., GST), and the use of central agencies
			- However,
				- NITI Aayog works on the principle of cooperative federalism
				- GST Council has representation from union as well as states
	- Conclusion
		- Therefore we can conclude that India's federal evolution has come a full circle starting from one party dominant federal model led by Congress to one party dominant model led by BJP.
- Cooperative Federalism
	- Cooperative federalism is a model where the national (Union) and subnational (State) governments collaborate, consult, and build consensus to formulate and implement policies. 
	- It emphasizes shared responsibility and coordination rather than conflict or strict hierarchy
	- Constitutional Basis and Institutional Mechanisms:
		- While the term "cooperative federalism" isn't explicitly used in the Constitution, its spirit is embodied in provisions like 
			- Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule, which allows for joint policymaking. 
			- The Finance Commission (Article 280) recommends financial devolution and grants-in-aid to ensure equitable resource sharing
			- Article 263: Provides for an Inter-State Council to discuss and coordinate policies
			- GST Council (Art. 279A): Perhaps the most visible institutionalization of cooperative federalism
			- All-India Services (Art. 312): Common bureaucracy serving both levels.
		- Replacing the Planning Commission in 2015, NITI Aayog was established to promote a "Team India" spirit and foster cooperative federalism
		- Zonal Councils promote regional cooperation and conflict resolution among states
- Competitive Federalism
	- Competitive federalism describes a scenario where states compete with each other for investment, innovation, and performance rankings
	- Manifestations and Implications:
		- Since economic liberalization in 1991, Indian states have increasingly vied for foreign direct investment (FDI), ease of doing business rankings, and infrastructure projects
		- Initiatives like Ease of Doing Business ranking and Smart Cities Mission are designed to reward state-level performance. 
		- NITI Aayog's SDG India Index and Fiscal Health Index also foster healthy competition.
	- Competitive federalism often complements cooperative mechanisms. 
	- While it can drive efficiency and growth, it also carries the risk of deepening inequalities between resource-rich and lagging states
- Asymmetric Federalism
	- Asymmetric federalism is a system where different constituent units (states or regions) within a federation enjoy varying degrees of autonomy and powers. 
	- This structural differentiation is a hallmark of Indian federalism
	- Rationale for Asymmetry:
		- Pluralism and Accommodation: 
			- India's vast linguistic, ethnic, religious, and regional diversity necessitated a flexible framework to accommodate differential identities and aspirations
		- Integration of Peripheral Regions: 
			- Special provisions were designed to integrate formerly princely states or ethno-culturally distinct regions into the Union and assuage separatist tendencies
		- Addressing Developmental Backwardness: 
			- Many special provisions aim to correct historical injustices and reduce regional imbalances
	- Constitutional and Administrative Manifestations in India:
		- Article 370 (now abrogated for Jammu and Kashmir) granted special autonomous status
		- Articles 371 to 371J provide special powers and responsibilities to various states (e.g., Nagaland, Mizoram, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Gujarat) to preserve local customs, tribal laws, and development rights
		- The Fifth and Sixth Schedules provide autonomous administrative structures for tribal-dominated areas in certain states. 
		- The Northeast, in particular, has been a "<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">laboratory of asymmetrical federalism</mark>"
	- Fiscal Asymmetry: 
		- This is evident in disproportionate fiscal transfers, discretionary grants to accommodate economically weaker or strategically significant states
	- Challenges
		- The manipulation or unilateral revocation of asymmetrical arrangements by the Union (as seen with J&K) can undermine federal trust
		- Coalition politics can also lead to asymmetrical bargaining power, where influential parties extract disproportionate benefits
- Measures to Improve Federalism
	- Strengthening Institutional Mechanisms
		- Activate and empower the Inter-State Council (Art. 263) as a standing forum for Centre–State dialogue rather than an occasional gathering.
		- Expand the role of Finance Commission to address not only revenue-sharing but also emerging fiscal asymmetries.
		- Ensure bodies like Zonal Councils function regularly for conflict resolution and cooperative policy-making.
	- Fiscal Federalism Reforms
		- Enhance the share of states in divisible taxes and rationalize centrally sponsored schemes to reduce fiscal dependency.
		- Provide greater flexibility to states in designing welfare schemes suited to their unique socio-economic contexts
