# Grassroots Democracy

- Introduction
	- Grassroots democracy in India refers to the system of local self-government, primarily implemented through Panchayats in rural areas and Municipalities in urban centers. 
	- This approach aims to bring governance closer to the people and is seen as a move from representative democracy to participatory democracy
- Historical Context and Evolution
	- Historically, India had village panchayats, though these were often dominated by upper castes. 
	- The British introduced accountable, representative local self-government and promoted financial decentralization to expand local governance to villages
		- Lord Rippon introduced elected local government bodies in 1882 called local boards
		- Following the Government of India Act 1919, village panchayats were established in a number of provinces.
		- This trend continued after the [[Government of India Act, 1935]]
	- Gandhian Vision (Swaraj)
		- During the independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi championed the ideal of village panchayats as "complete republics" embodying perfect democracy and individual freedom. 
		- His vision entailed a stateless, classless, decentralized society, where social justice would stem from individual character reform rather than top-down government initiatives
	- However, the Constituent Assembly largely opted for a direct, parliamentary, and federal constitution, rejecting a decentralized government
	- Gandhi's village panchayats were included in the Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 40)
	- A significant turning point came with the **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments**, which formally recognized a three-tier system of local self-government and made the adoption of the Panchayati Raj System obligatory for states. 
	- These amendments also mandated **33% reservation for women** in local bodies and made the Gram Sabha (village assembly) the focal point of village governance.
- Aims and Benefits
	- Enhanced Transparency and Accountability 
		- Decisions are made in open local forums, making government more transparent, accountable, and responsive to popular preferences
	- Increased Political Participation 
		- Local bodies institutionalize democracy at the grassroots by involving citizens in decision-making. 
		- Example: Gram Sabhas in villages, ward committees in cities.
		- Voter turnout is often highest in Panchayat elections
	- **Efficiency:** 
		- Local problems like sanitation, water supply, street lighting, primary education, or health can be solved faster without waiting for state-level intervention
	- Empowerment of Marginalized Groups 
		- Reservation for women, SCs, STs, and OBCs broadens participation and fosters social justice.
		- The Women's Reservation Act (2023) in Parliament and State Assemblies draws legitimacy from the success of women's representation in PRIs
	- Local Development and Welfare
		- Programs like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), which involve grassroots mechanisms like Gram Sabhas have shown improved performance in delivering benefits to the poor.
- Evolution of Local Self Government in Independent India
	- Community Development Program was introduced in 1952 which sought to promote people's participation in local development
	- National Extension Service (1953) was launched to extend development administration to every block and village. Each block had a Block Development Officer (BDO).
	- Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957) concluded that in the absence of people's participation these 2 programs have achieved little progress.
		- It recommended a three-tier system of Panchayati Raj
	- Subsequent efforts by the Ashok Mehta Committee (1978), L.M. Singhvi Committee (1986) and Gadgil Committee (1988) also stressed constitutional status to village panchayats
	- Finally, in 1992, through 73rd and 74th Amendment Panchayats and Municipalities were constitutionally recognised.
- Challenges and Limitations
	- **Incomplete Devolution**: 
		- A major hurdle is the reluctance of state governments to fully transfer functions, functionaries, and funds (the "3Fs") to local bodies
	- Fiscal Dependency: 
		- Local bodies heavily rely on state and central grants, limiting their capacity for revenue generation and developmental autonomy
	- Capacity Deficits: 
		- Lack of administrative training, technical expertise, and infrastructure hinders the effective exercise of authority by local representatives
	- Elite Capture and Persistence of Inequality 
		- Local institutions can still be dominated by existing power structures, with upper-caste, wealthier, and older men often intimidating or excluding women and lower castes
	- Proxy Politics ("Sarpanch Pati"): 
		- Proxy representation, where elected women are controlled by male relatives
- Conclusion
	- In sum, grassroots democracy is a critical component of inclusive democracy
	- However, challenges related to incomplete devolution, elite capture, and social hierarchies continue to limit its full transformative potential
