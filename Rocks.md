# Rocks

- Rocks are an aggregate of one or more minerals held together by chemical bonds.
- Feldspar and quartz are the most common minerals found in rocks
- Based on the mode of formation three major groups of rocks are defined: 
	- Igneous Rocks
		- Rocks formed out of solidification of magma (molten rock below the surface) and lava (molten rock above the surface) and are known as igneous or primary rocks
		- When magma in its upward movement cools and turns into solid form it is called igneous rock. 
		- The process of cooling and solidification can happen in the earth’s crust or on the surface of the earth
			- Intrusive igneous rocks (Plutonic rocks)
				- If magma cools slowly at great depths, mineral grains formed in the rocks may be very large.
				- e.g. Granite
			- Extrusive igneous rocks (Volcanic rocks)
				- Sudden cooling (at the surface) results in small and smooth grains in rocks as rapid cooling prevents crystallisation, as a result, such rocks are fine-grained.
				- e.g. Basalt
				- The Deccan traps in the Indian peninsular region is of basaltic origin.
		- Economic Significance of Igneous Rocks
			- Minerals of great economic value found in igneous rocks are magnetic iron, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, chromite, manganese, gold, diamond and platinum
			- Many igneous rocks like granite are used as building materials as they come in beautiful shades
	- Sedimentary Rocks
		- Sedimentary rocks are formed by lithification ― consolidation and compaction of sediments
		- Sediments are a result of denudation (weathering and erosion) of all types of rocks
		- These types of rocks cover 75 per cent of the earth’s crust
		- Ice deposited sedimentary rocks are called till or tillite. Wind-deposited sediments are called loess
			- Till or tillite is a type of rock made from the mixture of mud, sand, and stones left behind by melting glaciers (ice)
			- Loess is a soft, fine soil made from dust and sand that was blown by the wind and then settled on the ground
		- They are
			- stratified ― consist of many layers or strata
			- fossiliferous ― have fossils of plants and animals
			- generally porous and allow water to percolate
		- Eg: Sandstone, Limestone, Shale, Loess, Chalk, Tillite, Coal
		- Alluvial deposits in the Indo-Gangetic plain and coastal plains is of sedimentary accumulation
	- Metamorphic Rocks
		- Metamorphism is a process by which recrystallisation and reorganisation of minerals occur within a rock. 
		- This occurs due to pressure, volume and temperature changes
		- When rocks are forced down to lower levels by tectonic processes or when molten magma rising through the crust comes in contact with the crustal rocks, metamorphosis occurs
		- In the process of metamorphism in some rocks grains or minerals get arranged in layers or lines. Such an arrangement is called foliation or lineation.
			- When you can easily split the rock into thin sheets – that's foliation
			- eg: Slate
		- Sometimes minerals or materials of different groups are arranged into alternating thin to thick layers. Such a structure in is called banding
			- When dark and light layers alternate clearly -- that's banding
			- eg: Gneiss
- Rock Cycle
	- Rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones.
	- Igneous rocks are primary rocks and other rocks (sedimentary and metamorphic) form from these primary rocks. 
	- Igneous rocks can be changed into metamorphic rocks. 
	- The fragments derived out of igneous and metamorphic rocks form into sedimentary rocks. 
	- Sedimentary rocks themselves can turn into fragments and the fragments can be a source for formation of sedimentary rocks.
	- The crustal rocks (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary) may be carried down into the mantle (interior of the earth) through subduction process and the same meltdown and turn into molten magma, the source for igneous rocks

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Examples of Metamorphosis</mark>
- Granite -> Gneiss
- Clay, Shale on influence of Pressure -> Schist
- Clay, Shale on influence of temperature -> Slate
- Sandstone -> Quartzite
- Limestone -> Marble
