## Questions:

1. How can the demographic transition in the southern states, marked by low fertility rates and an ageing population, impact the region's economic growth and social welfare policies?

# Declining fertility levels in India

- Introduction
	- Demographic transition refers to the historical shift from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates, typically occurring as societies experience socio-economic development. 
	- Southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala have fertility rates well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman (NFHS-5, 2019-21).
- Why is fertility falling?
	- Increased female literacy, workforce participation of women
	- Changing societal attitudes towards marriage and reproduction
		- Preference to marry late, or not at all
		- Often choosing career and financial independence over motherhood
	- Rising cost of child-rearing
	- Rising rates of infertility in both men and women and abortions
	- Decline in infant and child mortality
	- Decades of government population control campaigns (“Hum Do, Hamare Do”)
- Implications
	- An ageing population, a declining young workforce and increased demands on healthcare and social security
	- _Dependency ratio_ (non-working to working population) rises sharply
	- Shrinking labor force -> Increased labor costs
	- Shift in consumption patterns from housing, education -> health services
	- Innovation slowdown risk
	- Demographic maturity may reduce the southern states' relative political representation under population-based delimitation in the future, potentially weakening their bargaining power in federal allocations
- Way Forward
	- Fertility decline is almost always irreversible and the graph, once it starts going down, may never bounce back eg: South Korea
	- **Pro-natal policies**: Paid parental leave, childcare subsidies, flexible work
	- **Higher labor force participation**: Encourage women, older adults
	- Automation & AI: Look at Japan
	- **Healthcare efficiency**: To reduce hospital costs
