# Ambedkar's views on Constitutionalism

- Introduction
	- Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Indian Constitution, articulated a deeply transformative vision of constitutionalism
	- Ambedkar viewed the Constitution as a tool to dismantle structural inequalities, particularly those rooted in caste, religion, and socio-economic deprivation
	- He saw it as a blueprint for a "social revolution"
- Key aspects of Ambedkar's view on constitutionalism:
	- **Commitment to Social Justice**: 
		- At the heart of Ambedkar's constitutionalism was an **uncompromising commitment to social justice**. 
		- He insisted that **political democracy without social democracy would be "a house built on sand"**. 
		- This meant that equality before the law must be accompanied by equality in social and economic life
	-  Vision of Democracy
		- He ensured **universal adult suffrage**, parliamentary government, and independent institutions like the Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General, and the judiciary to safeguard democratic procedures
		- He stressed that democracy should not be reduced to mere majoritarian rule and embedded **justiciable fundamental rights and safeguards for minorities and marginalized groups** to prevent the "grammar of anarchy"
	- Emphasis on Rule of Law and Constitutional Morality: 
		- He strongly emphasized the rule of law as the backbone of constitutional governance. 
		- He introduced the concept of "<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">constitutional morality</mark>," which he defined as the adherence to the spirit and principles of the Constitution beyond its text.
			- Ambedkar warned that India’s biggest challenge was not writing a Constitution, but **cultivating constitutional morality.**
				- Why? Because India had strong social habits of inequality (caste system), loyalty to charismatic leaders (Gandhi, Nehru, etc.), and little tradition of respecting institutions.
			- A good Constitution may be rendered useless by bad people, while a bad Constitution may work well if people follow constitutional spirit.
			- Ambedkar said constitutional morality is **not natural**, it has to be **cultivated** through education, civic culture, and continuous practice
			- Constitutional Morality is rooted in the constitution itself
				- Preamble: justice, liberty, equality, fraternity
				- Part III (Fundamental Rights) and Part IV (Directive Principles) → embody the values Ambedkar wanted protected
				- Separation of powers, independent judiciary, universal franchise → institutional safeguards for morality.
			- Relevant case laws
				- Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018)
					- SC: Constitutional morality to protect individual rights and dignity supersedes social morality
				- Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala (2018) – Sabarimala case
					- SC: Constitutional morality requires gender equality and dignity to prevail over religious customs.
				- NJAC case (2015)
					- SC: Court stressed judicial independence, but critics argued that true constitutional morality also demands accountability in appointments.
		- This demands tolerance, restraint, respect for institutional norms, and accountability from both rulers and citizens. 
	- **Reconciling Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity**: 
		- Ambedkar redefined liberty, equality, and fraternity as **mutually reinforcing and morally indivisible**. 
		- He famously warned that "Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative… Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things"
	- **Specific Constitutional Contributions**: 
		- As Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Ambedkar directly shaped many core constitutional provisions. 
		- He termed **Article 32, the Right to Constitutional Remedies, the "heart and soul of the Constitution"
		- He also influenced the inclusion of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs), clarifying that while non-justiciable, they were fundamental in the governance of the country
- Conclusion
	- Ambedkar’s constitutional vision remains profoundly relevant in contemporary India for resisting majoritarianism, defending minority rights, and addressing persistent caste and economic inequalities.
