# People's resistance against British before 1857

Before the large-scale Revolt of 1857, there was a century-long tradition of popular resistance to British domination in India. 

Notable Civil Uprisings (before 1857):
- Sanyasi Revolt (1763-1800)
	- Cause: 1770 famine, harsh British economic policies.
	- Participants: Peasants, evicted zamindars, disbanded soldiers, rural poor
	- Actions: Raided Company factories, treasuries; fought British forces. It was only after a prolonged action that Warren Hastings could subdue the sanyasis.
	- Leaders: Majnu Shah, Chirag Ali, Musa Shah, Bhawani Pathak, Debi Chaudhurani.
	- Significance: Hindu-Muslim unity (Fakir rebellion); inspired Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s _Anandamath_.
- Revolt of Moamarias (1769-1805)
	- **Cause**: Low-caste peasants challenged the oppressive Ahom Kings in Assam, who exploited the poor with Paik system (mandatory military service). 
	- **Impact**: Weakened Ahom rule, paving the way for Burmese invasions and, ultimately, the British annexation of Assam in 1826 (Treaty of Yandabo)
- Civil Uprisings in Gorakhpur, Basti, and Bahraich (1781): 
	- Cause: Warren Hastings's policy of involving English officers as revenue farmers (izaradars) in Awadh, which led to excessive revenue demands
- Poligars' Revolt (1795-1805), Tamil Nadu
	- Causes: British attempts to strip Poligars (feudal lords) of their traditional powers, land rights, and impose heavy taxes.
	- A series of armed uprisings by Poligars against British East India Company
	- Key personalities: Veerapandiya Kattabomman, Murudu brothers
- Civil Rebellion in Awadh (1799)
	- **Cause**: Deposition of Wazir Ali Khan
	- Impact: Led to "Massacre of Benares" -> Wazir Ali’s guards attacked the Magistrate of Benares

	- **Causes:** Harsh and exploitative terms of the Subsidiary Alliance imposed on the state of Travancore.
	- Key Personalities: Velu Thampi, the Dewan of Travancore

	- Local Surat populations attacked Europeans over increased salt duty and later resisted the introduction of Bengal Standard Weights and Measures
- Wahabi Movement (1830-61):

	- **Nature:** Declared British India as dar-ul-harb (land of infidels) and called for a jihad to restore Islamic rule.
	- **Key Leader:** Syed Ahmed of Rai Bareilly.

Peasant Movements
- Narkelberia Uprising (1831), Bengal
	- **Led by:** Titu Mir (Mir Nithar Ali).
	- **Causes:** Against oppressive Hindu zamindars (who imposed a "beard tax") and British indigo planters.
	- **Significance:** Considered the first armed peasant uprising against the British; later merged with the Wahabi movement.
- The Pagal Panthis (1825-1835): 
	- **Cause**: High rents opposed by Hajong and Garo tribes.
	- **Leader**: Tipu, son of Karam Shah.
- Faraizi Revolt (1838-1857): 
	- **Led by:** Dadu Mian.
	- **Causes:** Mobilized landless peasants against zamindars and the British. Many Faraizis later joined the Wahabi ranks
- Moplah uprisings (1836-1854), Malabar
	- **Causes:** Steep hikes in land revenue, reduction in the size of landholdings, and oppression by officials.

Tribal Movements
- Chuar Uprising (1766-72, 1795-1816)
	- Famine, enhanced land revenue demands and economic distress goaded the Chuar aboriginal tribesmen of Bengal and Bihar to take up arms.
- Kol Mutiny (1831)
	- The Kols of Chhotanagpur rose against large-scale land transfers to outsiders, heavy taxes, and the impact of British judicial and revenue policies on their traditional social conditions
- Ho and Munda Uprisings (1820-37, 1899-1900): 
	- Ho tribals revolted against the occupation of Singhbhum (Jharkhand), later joined by Mundas against new revenue policy and entry of Bengalis into their region
	- A significant uprising was the Ulgulan (1899-1900) under Birsa Munda, to fight against the loss of land to dikus (outsiders), exploitation by moneylenders, missionaries, and forest officials
- Santhal Rebellion (1855-56): 
	- A massive, organized insurrection against the oppression of zamindars, moneylenders, and the Company.
	- **Leaders:** Sidhu and Kanhu.
	- **Outcome:** Brutally suppressed, with over 15,000 Santhals killed. Led to the creation of the Santhal Parganas to offer some protection.
- Khond Uprisings (1837-1856) 
	- The Khonds of the hilly tracts extending from Odisha to the Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts of Andhra Pradesh revolted against Company rule.
- Bhil Revolts (1817-19, and later): 
	- In the Western Ghats, Bhils revolted due to famine, economic distress, and misgovernment, later fighting for a "Bhil Raj"

**Weaknesses of People's Uprisings**
Despite their scale, these early uprisings had common weaknesses:
- **Backward-Looking:** Often aimed to restore the old order (previous rulers/social structures) rather than envisioning a new, united India.
- **Localized:** Confined to specific regions, lacking an all-India character.
- **Outmatched Militarily:** Fought with traditional weapons (bows, arrows, swords) against a modern, disciplined British army


Connection to the 1857 Revolt: 
- These numerous incidents of resistance before 1857 indicated a simmering discontent and that "all was not well" under British rule. 
- They laid strong and valuable local traditions of resistance which later served as inspiration for the broader nationalist struggle for freedom. 
- The 1857 Revolt itself was a culmination of this century-long tradition of fierce popular resistance
