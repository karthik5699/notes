# Inland Water Transport

- Introduction
	- Inland Water Transport (IWT) in India involves the movement of goods and passengers through navigable rivers, canals, and other inland waterways. 
	- India has about 14,500 km of navigable waterways, but currently only about 3.5% of trade happens through waterways compared to higher shares in countries like China (47%), Europe (40%), and Bangladesh (35%).
- Prospects of Inland Water Transport in India
	- Cost-Effective
		- Cheapest mode per tonne-km; consumes less fuel compared to road/rail. 
		- Ideal for bulk cargo like coal, cement, fertilizers.
	- Eco-Friendly
		- Lower emissions and fuel use; reduces highway congestion and accidents.
	- Huge Untapped Potential
		- India has 111 National Waterways. 
		- Only a few (like NW-1: Ganga, NW-2: Brahmaputra, NW-3: Kerala backwaters) are operational at scale.
	- Tourism and Passenger Potential
		- Backwaters of Kerala, cruise tourism in Ganga, Brahmaputra, and Sundarbans have high promise.
	- Regional Connectivity
		- Boosts trade with Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan via river systems. 
		- Northeast India in particular can benefit.
	- Employment Generation
		- Shipbuilding, port handling, logistics, tourism—all can create large numbers of jobs.
- Problems of Inland Water Transport in India
	- Seasonal and Unreliable Flow
		- Many rivers in India are non-perennial. 
		- Water depth fluctuates due to monsoons, making navigation seasonal.
	- Shallow Draft and Siltation
		- Most rivers don’t maintain the minimum required depth (usually 2–3 meters).
		- Heavy silt deposits reduce navigability.
	- Slow Speeds
		- Average vessel speed is much slower than road/rail, making it unattractive for time-sensitive goods.
	- Poor Last-Mile Connectivity
		- Even if goods reach a river port, road/rail links to markets are weak. 
		- This breaks the supply chain.
- Government Initiatives
	- Sagarmala Programme (2015): 
		- Aims to revolutionize India's maritime sector by promoting coastal and inland waterways for cargo transportation.
	- PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan: 
		- Integrated multi-modal infrastructure plan to connect roads, rail, ports, airports, and logistics in a unified digital platform.
	- Jalvahak Scheme (2024): 
		- Encourages business enterprises to use inland waterways for safe, timely, and cost-effective cargo delivery.
- Conclusion
	- With sustained investment, better dredging, smart integration with road-rail, and eco-friendly practices, Inland Water Transport can become the backbone for India’s transport system.
