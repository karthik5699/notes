# Thunderstorms

![[Pasted image 20250710154327.png]]

- Introduction
	- Thunderstorms and tornadoes are severe local storms. They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but are violent
	- Thunderstorm is a storm with thunder and lightning and typically also heavy rain or hail.
	- Thunderstorms **mostly occur on ground** where the temperature is high. Thunderstorms are less frequent on water bodies due to low temperature.
- How does a thunderstorm form?
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710154606.png]]
	- Cumulus stage
		- Ground is significantly heated due to solar insolation.
		- A low pressure starts to establish due to intense upliftment of an air parcel (convention).
		- Air from the surroundings start to rush in to fill the low pressure.
		- Intense convection of moist hot air builds up a towering cumulonimbus cloud
	- Mature Stage
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710154944.png]]
		- Characterized by intense updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow bigger and rise to greater height.
		- Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and rain
		- The incoming of thunderstorm is indicated by violent gust of wind. This wind is due to the intense downdraft
	- Dissipating stage
		- When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. Intense precipitation occurs.
		- In a matter of few minutes, the storm dissipates and clear weather starts to prevail.
- Downbursts
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710155324.png]]
	- Downdrafts are referred to as macrobursts or microbursts.
	- Macroburst is more than 4 km in diameter and can produce winds as high as 60 metres per second, or 215 km per hour.
	- A microburst is smaller in dimension but produces winds as high as 75 metres per second, or 270 km per hour
	- They are seriously hazardous to aircrafts, especially during takeoffs and landings
- Types of Thunderstorms
	- Thermal thunderstorm
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710155532.png]]
		- Caused due to intense heating of ground during summer.
	- Orographic thunderstorm
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710155644.png]]
		- Forceful upliftment of warm moist air parcel when it passes over a mountain barrier creates cumulonimbus cloud causing heavy precipitation on the windward side.
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orographic ‘Cloud bursts’ are common in Jammu and Kashmir, Cherrapunji and Mawsynram</mark>.
	- Frontal thunderstorm
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710155754.png]]
		- Thunderstorms occurring along cold fronts.
	- Single-cell thunderstorm
		- Single-cell thunderstorms are small, brief, weak storms that grow and die within an hour or so. They are typically driven by heating on a summer afternoon
		- Single-cell storms may produce brief heavy rain and lightning (Very common in India during summers, mostly April, May. In Kerala they are called ‘Mango Showers’ and in Karnataka ‘Blossom showers’).
	- A multi-cell thunderstorm
		- A multi-cell storm is a thunderstorm in which new updrafts form along the leading edge of rain-cooled air (the gust front).
			- A gust front is the boundary where the cool air from a thunderstorm spreads out during downdraft
			- As the cool air pushes into the warm, moist air ahead, it lifts it upward, creating new updrafts
		- Individual cells usually last 30 to 60 minutes, while the system as a whole may last for many hours
		- Multi-cell storms may produce hail, strong winds, brief tornadoes, and/or flooding
	- A super-cell thunderstorm
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710160728.png]]
		- A super-cell is a long-lived (greater than 1 hour) and highly organized storm feeding off an updraft (a rising current of air) that is tilted and rotating.
		- Most large and violent tornadoes come from super-cells.
- Lightning and thunder
	- As water vapour moves upward in the cumulonimbus cloud, decreasing temperatures causes it to condense.
	- The heat (latent heat of condensation) generated in the process pushes the water molecules further up.
	- As they move beyond zero degrees, water droplets change into small ice crystals.
	- As they continue to move up, they gather mass — until they are so heavy that they start to fall.
	- This leads to a system where smaller ice crystals move up while bigger crystals come down.
	- The resulting **collisions** trigger the release of **electrons**, in a process very similar to the generation of electric sparks
	- The moving free electrons cause more collisions and more electrons, as a chain reaction ensues.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710163932.png]]
	- The process results in a situation in which the top layer of the cloud gets positively charged (cations) while the middle layer is negatively (anions) charged
	- The electrical potential difference between the two layers is huge
	- In little time, a huge current starts to flow between the layers
	- It produces heat, leading to the heating of the air column between the two layers of cloud
	- It is because of this **heat** that the air column looks red during lightning
	- The heated air column expands and produces **shock waves** that result in thunder.
	- #### Lightning from cloud to Earth
		- ![[Pasted image 20250710162816.png]]
		- Earth is a good conductor of electricity but is electrically neutral.
		- In comparison to the middle layer of the cloud (anion), however, the ground becomes relatively positive charged.
		- As a result, a flow of current (about 15%) gets directed towards the Earth as well
		- It is this current flow that results in the damage to life and property.
		- Once about 80-100 m from the surface, lightning tends to change course to hit the taller objects
			- Tall buildings have a vertical pole (lightning rod) to safely direct lightning into the ground, protecting the structure from damage. It provides a low-resistance path for the electric charge
		- This is because travelling through air, which is a bad conductor of electricity, electrons try to find a better conductor, and also the shortest route to the relatively positively charged Earth’s surface
- The world’s most electric place

	- Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela
	- At the place where the Catatumbo river falls into Lake Maracaibo
- Tornado

	- From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force, with very low pressure at the center, causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is called a tornado.
	- Tornadoes generally occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called water sprouts.
	- These violent storms are the manifestation of the atmosphere’s adjustments to varying energy distribution. The potential and heat energies are converted into kinetic energy in these storms and the restless atmosphere again returns to its stable state.
	- Tornadoes occur most often in association with thunderstorms during the spring and summer in the mid-latitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
	- These whirling atmospheric vortices can generate the strongest winds known on Earth: wind speeds in the range of 500 km per hour.
	- They are often referred to as **twisters or cyclones**
- Distribution of tornadoes
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710165600.png]]
	- Rare in polar regions and infrequent at latitudes higher than 50° N and 50° S
	- The temperate and tropical regions are the most prone to thunderstorms.
	- United States has the most violent tornadoes.
	- In the Indian sub-continent, Bangladesh is the most prone country to tornadoes
- Waterspout
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710165908.png]]
	- They are tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms, but simply occurring over water.
