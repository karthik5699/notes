- Introduction
	- The Godavari basin extends over Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha, in addition to smaller parts in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Puducherry
	- The basin is bounded by Satmala hills, Ajanta range, and Mahadeo hills on the north, by the Eastern Ghats on the south and the east, and by the Western Ghats on the west.
	- The Godavari basin is the second largest basin in India.
	- Godavari River rises from <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Trimbakeshwar in the Nashik district of Maharashtra</mark>. Also called Dakshina Ganga
	- It is the largest Peninsular India river that drains into the Bay of Bengal
- Pranhita River
	- The Penganga River, which rises in the Ajanta Range in Maharashtra, is a tributary of the Wardha River, which is itself a tributary of the Wainganga River
	- The Wardha originates in the Satpura Range in Madhya Pradesh. It flows southward and eventually joins the Wainganga River in Maharashtra.
	- The Wainganga River originates in the Mahadeo Hills of Madhya Pradesh
	- The combined waters of the Penganga River, the Wardha River, and the Wainganga Rivers are known as the Pranhita River, the largest tributary of the Godavari River.
	- It forms the boundary between Maharashtra and Telangana.
- The Manjira is the only important right bank tributary. It joins the Godavari after passing through the Nizam Sagar.
- Since it’s a monsoon-fed river, it swells massively in rainy season → frequent floods, especially in Andhra Pradesh’s low-lying deltas.
- Polavaram Dam is being built to control floods, store water, and supply irrigation & drinking water.
