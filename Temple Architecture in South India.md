# Temple Architecture in South India

**Historical Context**
- Early period: Sangam age and megalithic shrines
- Medieval dynasties: Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas
- Later influences: Vijayanagara and Nayakas period

**Architectural Styles**
- **Dravidian Style**
- **Vesara Style**

Temple Architecture in South India began under the Pallava ruler Mahendravarman. The temples developed during the Pallava dynasty can be classified into 4 stages chronologically:

1. Mahendra group
	- first stage of Pallava temple architecture
	- basically rock-cut temples
	- temples were known as mandapas
2. Narasimha group
	- rock-cut temples were decorated by intricate sculptures
	- the mandapas were divided into separate rathas
	- the biggest one was called dharmaraja ratha, while the smallest one was called draupadi ratha
	- Dravidian style of architecture is the successor of Dharmaraja ratha
	- eg: Pancha-rathas at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu
3. Rajsimha group
	- development of real structural temples in place of rock-cut temples
	- eg: Shore temple at Mahabalipuram
4. Nandivarman group
	- temples were smaller in size
	- features were almost similar to Dravidian style

After the decline of Pallava dynasty, temple architecture acquired a new style under the Chola kingdom, known as Dravidian style of temple architecture or [[Chola Temple Architecture]]. In later periods [[Vesara School of Temple Architecture]] also emerged.

## Personal Analysis:

the Shore temple at Mahabalipuram houses 3 shrines: 2 for Shiva and one to Vishnu, who is shown as Anantashayana. this is unusual because temples generally have a single main shrine and not three areas of worship. this shows that it was probably not originally conceived and different shrines may have been added during different times.
