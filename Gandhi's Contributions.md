# Gandhi's Contributions

![[Pasted image 20250722181244.png]]

Mahatma Gandhi was the pivotal figure in India’s freedom struggle, transforming it from an elite-led movement into a mass-based, non-violent struggle, drawing on his philosophy of satyagraha (truth-force) and ahimsa (non-violence).

Key Contributions:

1. Evolution of Satyagraha in South Africa (1893-1914):
	- Gandhi initially relied on "Moderate" methods like petitions and memorials to British authorities, hoping for redress of grievances
		- He established the Natal Indian Congress and started the newspaper <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Indian Opinion</mark> to unite Indians and publicize their demands
	- By 1906, he developed satyagraha, a philosophy of truth-focused, non-violent non-cooperation. 
		- This was first employed against discriminatory legislation requiring Indians to carry registration certificates with fingerprints
	- His experiences in South Africa demonstrated the immense capacity of the masses for sacrifice and unity across different religions, classes, and genders.
		- He refined his leadership style and techniques of struggle, which proved to be a blueprint for future movements in India
2. Early Interventions in India (1917-1918)
	- After returning to India in January 1915, Gandhi spent a year traveling to understand the country's condition
	- Champaran Satyagraha (1917): 
		- He was invited by Rajkumar Shukla to address the exploitation of indigo farmers in Bihar under the tinkathia system
		- Gandhi defied an official order from the British to leave and, as a member of an inquiry committee, successfully advocated for the abolition of the tinkathia system and compensation for peasants
		- This was his first civil disobedience in India
	- Ahmedabad Mill Strike (1918): 
		- He intervened in a dispute between mill owners and workers over plague bonus, leading to a hunger strike (his first) to strengthen workers' resolve
		- this resulted in a 35% wage hike mediated by a tribunal
		- He helped form the Ahmedabad Textile Labour Association
	- Kheda Satyagraha (1918): 
		- Because of drought in 1918, the crops failed in Kheda district of Gujarat, Gandhi advised farmers not to pay taxes
		- Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and other Gandhians organised the villagers and told them what to do and gave the necessary political leadership
	- These localized struggles showcased the efficacy of satyagraha and helped Gandhi understand the masses' strengths and weaknesses
3. Leading National Mass Movements
	- Rowlatt Satyagraha (1919): 
		- In response to the repressive Rowlatt Act, which curtailed civil liberties, Gandhi called for a nationwide hartal (strike) and civil disobedience
		- This movement saw widespread protests, especially in Punjab, leading to the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
	- Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)
		- the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation. Though the two movements emerged from separate issues, they adopted a common programme of action—that of non-violent non-cooperation
		- The Khilafat issue was not directly linked to Indian politics but it provided the immediate background to the movement and gave an added advantage of cementing Hindu-Muslim unity against the British
		- The Rowlatt Act, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, and the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms provided the immediate context for the movement.
		- The movement included 
			- surrender of titles and honours
			- boycotts of government schools, colleges, law courts, foreign goods, and liquor
			- and could be extended to include resignation from government service and mass civil disobedience including the non-payment of taxes
			- National schools and colleges were to be set up
			- panchayats were to be established for settling disputes
			- people were asked to maintain Hindu- Muslim unity, give up untouchability and observe strict non-violence
		- Gandhiji promised that if the programme was fully implemented, Swaraj would be ushered in within a year.
		- The goal of the Congress was changed from the attainment of self-government by constitutional and legal means to the attainment of Swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means
		- Women gave up purdah and offered their ornaments for the Tilak Fund. They joined the movement in large numbers and took active part in picketing before the shops selling foreign cloth and liquor.
		- The Tilak Swaraj Fund was oversubscribed and one crore rupees collected.
		- Gandhi withdrew the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident (February 1922), where violence erupted, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to non-violence
		- In March 1922, Gandhi was arrested and sentenced to six years in jail. He made the occasion memorable by a magnificent court speech: “I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is deliberate crime, and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.”
	- Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934)
		- In 1927 the British government in England decided to send a commission headed by Lord Simon to decide India’s political future. 
		- The Commission had no Indian representative. 
			- The decision created an outrage in India.
		- The decade closed with the Congress resolving to fight for Purna Swaraj (complete independence) in 1929 under the presidentship of Jawaharlal Nehru.
			- Consequently, “Independence Day” was observed on 26 January 1930 all over the country.
		- Purna Swaraj would never come on its own. It had to be fought for. In 1930, Gandhiji declared that he would lead a march to break the salt law.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250722182159.png]]
		- Gandhiji and his followers marched from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi where they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt.
		- Gandhi openly asked the people to make salt from sea water in their homes and violate the salt law
		- The movement spread rapidly, including non-payment of revenue, no-chowkidara tax campaigns, and violation of forest laws
		- The movement demonstrated the widespread nationalist sentiment and significantly impacted British imports and government revenue
		- It eventually led to the Gandhi-Irwin Pact and the Second Round Table Conference
	- Harijan Campaign (1932-1934)
		- Opposing the Communal Award's attempt to create separate electorates for depressed classes, Gandhi undertook a fast and signed the Poona Pact
		- He launched a nationwide campaign against untouchability, founding the All India Anti-Untouchability League (Harijan Sevak Sangh) and the weekly Harijan
		- He undertook a comprehensive Harijan tour from covering over 20,000 km, raising funds for the Harijan Sevak Sangh, and propagating the removal of untouchability in all its forms
		- He advocated for temple entry for untouchables, stressing humanism and reason over tradition
		- He emphasized that untouchability had no sanction in the Hindu Shastras, and if it did, such scriptures should be ignored as they went against human dignity
		- His campaign also promoted internal reforms among Harijans, including education, cleanliness, hygiene, giving up beef and carrion, and alcohol consumption
		- Gradually, the campaign carried the message of nationalism to Harijans who also happened to be the agricultural labourers in most parts of the country, leading to their increasing participation in the national and peasant movements.
	- Quit India Movement (1942)
		- After the failure of the Cripps Mission, Gandhi called for British withdrawal and launched the "Quit India" campaign with the mantra "Do or Die"
		- Gandhi’s General Instructions to Different Sections
			- Government servants: Do not resign but declare your allegiance to the Congress
			- Soldiers: Do not leave the Army but do not fire on compatriots
			- Peasants: If zamindars are anti-government, pay mutually agreed rent, and if zamindars are pro-government, do not pay rent
			- Princely states’ people: Support the ruler only if he is anti-government and declare yourselves to be a part of the Indian nation.
		- In the early hours of August 9, 1942, in a single sweep, all the top leaders of the Congress were arrested and taken to unknown destinations
		- the movement led to widespread strikes, acts of sabotage, and the establishment of "parallel governments" in several areas (Satara, Tamluk)
		- Women, especially school and college girls, actively participated, and included Aruna Asaf Ali, Sucheta Kripalani and Usha Mehta.
