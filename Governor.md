# Governor

- Introduction
	- The Governor is a key constitutional figure in the Indian federal system, serving as the nominal head of the state executive and the President's representative in each state.
	- Their role and powers have been a subject of ongoing discussion and occasional controversy since India's independence
- Appointment and Constitutional Position
	- The Governor is appointed by the President of India and holds office at the President's pleasure for a term of five years
	- Early Debates: 
		- In the early stages of drafting the Constitution, there was a consideration for Governors to be directly elected and possess some discretionary powers.
		- However, this idea was rejected by the Constituent Assembly to avoid potential friction with popularly elected state ministries and to align the Governor's status with that of the President
	- Nominal Head: 
		- Under the parliamentary system, the Governor is primarily a constitutional head of the state, with the real executive power vested in the Council of Ministers, led by the Chief Minister. 
		- The Governor is expected to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers
	- Long Arm of the Centre: 
		- Despite the intention of a minimal role, Governors have often intervened at the behest of the Central government and are frequently seen as the "long arm" or "eyes and ears" of the Centre, sometimes neglecting state interests
- Executive Powers
	- State Administration
		- The Governor heads the state executive and performs functions like appointing the Chief Minister and other Ministers (on the Chief Minister's advice), the Advocate-General of the State, and members of the State Public Service Commission
	- Pardoning Power
		- The Governor has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, or to suspend, remit, or commute sentences for offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the State extends.
		- However, they generally lack the power to pardon a death sentence or a sentence by court martial
- Legislative Powers
	- Ordinance-Making Power: 
		- Similar to the President at the Union level, the Governor can promulgate ordinances when the state legislature is not in session and immediate action is required
	- Assent to Bills: 
		- The Governor assents to bills passed by the state legislature
- Discretionary Powers
	- Appointment of Chief Minister: 
		- In situations of a hung assembly (where no single party or pre-poll coalition secures a clear majority), the Governor exercises discretion in inviting a leader to form the government
	- Recommendation for President's Rule (Article 356): 
		- The Governor can recommend to the President that the constitutional machinery in the state has broken down, leading to the imposition of President's Rule. 
		- This is a subjective judgment and has been frequently misused by the Centre for political ends
	- Reservation of Bills for Presidential Assent (Article 200): 
		- The Governor may reserve certain bills passed by the state legislature for the consideration of the President
	- Discretion in Sixth Schedule Areas: 
		- Governors of certain North Eastern States exercise quasi-legislative and executive powers with respect to tribal autonomous councils
- Implications for Federalism and Democratic Governance
	- The Governor's role has significant implications for the balance of power between the Union and the states
		- Erosion of Federal Principles: 
			- The fact that Governors are appointed by the Union Executive creates an inherent conflict of interest, especially when the ruling party at the Centre differs from that in the state. 
			- This can lead to partisan use of discretionary powers.
		- Politicization of the Office: 
			- The Governor's office is often seen as a political agent of the Union, rather than a neutral constitutional authority
		- Misuse of Article 356
			- The provision of President's rule which was intended to be a 'dead letter' unless exceptional circumstances has been used more than 100 times since independence.
- Judicial Pronouncements and Reform Proposals
	- Judicial Intervention:
		- Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab (1974): 
			- The Supreme Court held that the Governor is generally bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers, and discretionary powers are exceptional and narrowly construed
		- S.R. Bommai v. Union of India (1994): 
			- This landmark judgment curtailed the arbitrary misuse of Article 356, ruling that presidential proclamations were subject to judicial review and affirming federalism as part of the basic structure of the Constitution
	- Reform Proposals:
		- Sarkaria Commission (1988): 
			- Recommended that the Governor should be a politically neutral figure, not intimately connected with Central politics
			- And urged consultation with the Chief Minister in appointment of Governor
		- Punchhi Commission (2010): 
			- Emphasized codification of discretionary powers, greater transparency, and a fixed tenure of five years to ensure institutional independence
- Comparison with Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi
	- The Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi has a unique position, representing a special form of asymmetry in Indian federalism:
		- Unlike state Governors, the LG of Delhi has constitutionally empowered discretionary authority, particularly over matters of land, police, and public order, which remain reserved for the Union Government
		- The LG can refer matters of disagreement with the Council of Ministers to the President (effectively the Union Cabinet), which can stall decisions of the elected Delhi government
- Conclusion
	- In summary, the Governor's office remains a persistent source of structural tension in Indian federalism
	- Its functioning is shaped less by formal constitutional provisions alone and more by political contingencies and party dynamics, frequently leading to allegations of central overreach
