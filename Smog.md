## Questions:

1. Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata are the three mega cities of the country but the air pollution is much more serious problem in Delhi as compared to the other two. Why is this so?

# Smog

- Smog
	- ![[Pasted image 20250709213319.png]]
	- Smog = smoke + fog (smoky fog) caused by the burning of large amounts of coal, vehicular emission and industrial fumes (Primary pollutants)
	- Smog contains soot particulates like smoke, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other components
	- At least two distinct types of smog are recognized: sulphurous smog and photochemical smog.
- Sulphurous smog
	- Sulphurous smog is also called “London smog”
	- Sulphurous smog results from a high concentration of SULPHUR OXIDES in the air and is caused by the use of sulphur-bearing fossil fuels, particularly coal
	- This type of smog is aggravated by dampness and a high concentration of suspended particulate matter in the air.
- Photochemical smog
	- Photochemical smog is also known as “Los Angeles smog”
	- Photochemical smog occurs most prominently in urban areas that have large numbers of automobiles (Nitrogen oxides are the primary emissions)
	- Photochemical (summer smog) forms when pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (primary pollutant) and organic compounds (primary pollutants) react together in the presence of SUNLIGHT. A gas called OZONE (Secondary pollutant) is formed.
	- **Nitrogen Dioxide  +  Sunlight  +  Hydrocarbons  =  Ozone (Ozone in stratosphere it is beneficial, but near the earth’s surface it results in global warming as it is a greenhouse gas)**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250709214024.png]]
	- The resulting smog causes a light brownish coloration of the atmosphere, reduced visibility, plant damage, irritation of the eyes, and respiratory distress
	- Reactions:

- Effects of Smog
	- The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Mexico City and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground
	- It is usually highly toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened life or death
	- Smog is a combination of airborne particulate matter, like soot, and invisible toxic gases including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), which are carcinogens
	- Temperature inversions are accentuated and precipitation is reduced






## Personal Analysis:

India is the world’s second largest source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas that heats up the atmosphere far more than carbon dioxide. **Agriculture is a major source**.
