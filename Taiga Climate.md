# Taiga Climate

![[Pasted image 20250716180128.png]]

- Boreal Climate OR Taiga Climate OR Siberian Climate
	- Found only in the northern hemisphere
	- Experienced in the regions just below Arctic circle
	- On its poleward side, it merges into the **Arctic tundra**.
	- The climate fades into the temperate Steppe climate
- Distribution
	- It stretches along a continuous belt across **central Canada**, some parts of **Scandinavian Europe** and most of **central and southern Russian**. **(50° to 70° N)**
- Taiga Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250716180537.png]]
	- Temperature
		- Summers are brief and warm reaching 20-25 °C whereas winters are long and brutally cold – always 30-40 °C below freezing
		- Annual temperature range of the Siberian Climate is the greatest
		- All over Russia, nearly all the rivers are frozen. In normal years, the Volga is ice-covered for about 150 days.
		- Occasionally cold, northerly polar local winds such as the blizzards of Canada and buran of Eurasia blow violently
	- Precipitation
		- Maritime influence in the interiors is absent.
		- Typical annual precipitation ranges from 38 cm to 63 cm.
		- In winter the precipitation is in the form of snow, as mean temperatures are well below freezing all the time.
- Natural Vegetation of Taiga Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250717153106.png]]
	- The predominant vegetation is evergreen coniferous forest.
	- The greatest single band of the coniferous forest is the taiga (a Russian word for coniferous forest) in Siberia
	- In North America, the belt stretches from Alaska across Canada into Labrador
	- Softwood trees
		- The coniferous forest belts of Eurasia and North America are the richest sources of softwood.
		- Softwood is used in building construction, furniture, matches, paper and pulp, rayon and other branches of the chemical industry.
		- The world’s greatest softwood producers are Russia, U.S.A., Canada and the Fenoscandian countries (Finland, Norway and Sweden)
		- In the production of wood pulp (by both chemical and mechanical methods), the U.S.A. is the leader.
		- But in the field of newsprint, Canada accounts for almost half of the world’s total annual production.
	- Characteristics of Coniferous forests
		- Almost all conifers are evergreen. There is no annual replacement of new leaves as in deciduous trees.
		- Conifers are conical in shape. Their conical shape and sloping branches prevent snow accumulation. It also offers little grip to the winds
		- Transpiration can be quite rapid in the warm summer. So, leaves are small, thick, leathery and needle-shaped to check excessive transpiration.
		- Coniferous forests are also found in regions with high elevation (Example: The forests just below the snow-line in Himalayas).
- Economic Development of Taiga Region
	- Lumbering
		- This is the most important occupation of the Siberian type of climate.
		- The vast reserves of coniferous forests provide the basis for the lumbering industry.
		- Rivers for transportation: 
			- The soft wood logs easily float on rivers. Hence rivers are used to transport logs to the sawmills located down the stream
		- Paper and pulp industry: 
			- Timber is pulped by both chemical and mechanical means to make wood pulp. 
			- Wood pulp is the raw material for paper-making and newsprint.
