# Impediments to women's participation in local governance

- Introduction
	- Women's participation in local governance faces a range of significant challenges, stemming from societal attitudes, institutional design, and political party dynamics.
	- While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts aimed to deepen democracy by ensuring representation for women, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in local bodies through reservations, their implementation has often fallen short.
- Key impediments
	- **Societal and Cultural Discrimination:
		- The pervasive influence of patriarchy remains a major hurdle
		- Women have often remained excluded from the public sphere, making their entry into local council seats particularly unsettling to many
		- A majority of women in rural areas especially have been illiterate or scarcely literate, limiting their capacity to exercise influence
	- **Institutional and Structural Barriers**:
		- Constituencies reserved for women, as well as chairpersons' posts, change or rotate at each election. 
		- This significantly reduces a woman's chance of reelection, ensuring that the vast majority of women councillors remain inexperienced
		- Women's participation is constrained by reliance on an uncooperative bureaucracy and a dearth of independent staffing
	- Political Party Dynamics and Support:
		- Most political parties are often disinterested in panchayat elections at the local level and have a poor record of supporting women candidates
		- Women's access to power is often mediated by their relationship to male kin, leading to an indirect and symbolic exercise of power. (Sarpanch pati)
- Conclusion
	- These factors collectively create a challenging environment for women seeking to engage meaningfully in local governance, despite constitutional mandates for their inclusion
