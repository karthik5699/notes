## Questions:

1. Account for variations in oceanic salinity and discuss its multi-dimensional effects.

# Ocean Salinity

- Introduction
	- Salinity is the term used to define the total content of dissolved salts in sea water.
	- It is calculated as the amount of salt (in gm) dissolved in 1,000 gm (1 kg) of seawater
	- It is usually expressed as parts per thousand or ppt.
- Role of Ocean Salinity
	- Salinity determines compressibility, thermal expansion, temperature, density, absorption of insolation, evaporation and humidity.
	- It also influences the composition and movement of the sea: water and the distribution of fish and other marine resources.
	- Share of different salts
		- sodium chloride — 77.7%
		- magnesium chloride—10.9%
		- magnesium sulphate —4.7%
		- calcium sulphate — 3.6%
		- potassium sulphate — 2.5%
- Factors Affecting Ocean Salinity
	- The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend mainly on evaporation and precipitation. 
	- Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by the fresh water flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the processes of freezing and thawing of ice.
	- Wind, also influences salinity of an area by transferring water to other areas
	- The ocean currents contribute to the salinity variations.
	- Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated. Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the salinity of an area.
		- Warmer water holds less dissolved salt, reducing salinity. Colder water can dissolve more salt, increasing salinity.
- Horizontal distribution of salinity

	- High salinity regions
		- In the land locked Red Sea (don’t confuse this to Dead Sea which has much greater salinity), it is as high as 41 o/oo (parts per thousand)
		- In hot and dry regions, where evaporation is high, the salinity sometimes reaches to 70.
	- Comparatively Low salinity regions
		- In the estuaries (enclosed mouth of a river where fresh and saline water get mixed) and the Arctic, the salinity fluctuates from 0 – 35
	- Pacific
		- The salinity variation in the Pacific Ocean is mainly due to its shape and larger areal extent.
	- Atlantic
		- The average salinity of the Atlantic Ocean is around 36-37
		- The equatorial region of the Atlantic Ocean has a salinity of about 35.
		- Near the equator, there is heavy rainfall, high relative humidity, cloudiness and calm air of the doldrums.
		- The polar areas experience very little evaporation and receive large amounts of fresh water from the melting of ice. This leads to low levels of salinity, ranging between 20 and 32.
		- Maximum salinity (37) is observed between 20° N and 30° N and 20° W – 60° W. It gradually decreases towards the north.
	- Indian Ocean
		- The average salinity of the Indian Ocean is 35.
		- The low salinity trend is observed in the Bay of Bengal due to influx of river water by the river Ganga.
		- On the contrary, the Arabian Sea shows **higher salinity** due to high evaporation and low influx of fresh water.
	- Marginal seas
		- The North Sea, in spite of its location in higher latitudes, records higher salinity due to more saline water brought by the North Atlantic Drift.
		- Baltic Sea records low salinity due to influx of river waters in large quantity.
		- The **Mediterranean Sea** records higher salinity due to high evaporation
		- Salinity is, however, very low in **Black Sea** due to enormous fresh water influx by rivers.
	- Cold and warm water mixing zones
		- ![[Pasted image 20250721135501.png]]
		- Salinity decreases from 35 – 31 on the western parts of the northern hemisphere because of the influx of melted water from the Arctic region.
- Vertical Distribution of Salinity
	- Salinity changes with depth, but the way it changes depends upon the location of the sea.
	- Salinity at the surface increases by the loss of water to ice or evaporation, or decreased by the input of fresh waters, such as from the rivers.
	- Salinity at depth is very much fixed, because there is no way that water is ‘lost’, or the salt is ‘added.’ 
	- There is a marked difference in the salinity between the surface zones and the deep zones of the oceans.
	- The lower salinity water rests above the higher salinity dense water.
	- Salinity, generally, increases with depth and there is a distinct zone called the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">halocline</mark> (compare this with thermocline), where salinity increases sharply.
	- Other factors being constant, increasing salinity of seawater causes its density to increase. High salinity seawater, generally, sinks below the lower salinity water. This leads to **stratification by salinity**.
