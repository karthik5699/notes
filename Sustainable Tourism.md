# Sustainable Tourism

- Introduction
	- Unscientific and unregulated tourism, driven by commercial interests, has transformed ecologically fragile regions like the Himalayas into disaster-prone areas.
	- Recent events in Uttarakhand highlight the severe vulnerabilities created by such human activities
- Vulnerabilities from Unregulated tourism
	- Infrastructure Overload
		- Unplanned construction of roads, tunnels and hotels often flouting environmental norms, destabilise fragile slopes of Himalayas and Western Ghats
	- Exceeding carrying capacity
		- Mass tourism puts immense pressure on finite local resources like water and generates unmanageable solid waste
		- This leads to environmental degradation, polluting rivers and soil
	- Ecological disruption
		- Deforestation for tourism projects destroys natural carbon sinks and loosens top soil
		- Similarly, destruction of coastal mangroves for resorts removes natural barriers against cyclones & tsunamis.
- Strategies for Sustainable Tourism
	- Regulatory Framework
		- Mandate scientific assessments of the carrying capacity for all tourist destinations & create zonal master plans to regulate development as recommended by committees like the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Gadgil Committee</mark> for the Western Ghats
	- Community-centric models
		- Promote community-based ecotourism where local populations are stakeholders in conservation
		- The role of home-stays in offering travellers culturally immersive experiences while simultaneously fostering local entrepreneurship and employment generation
	- Green Protocols
		- Enforce sustainable practices for the hospitality sector, such as mandatory rainwater harvesting, waste segregation and use of renewable energy
- Conclusion
	- Balancing economic aspirations with ecological preservation through a robust regulatory framework & community participation is the only way to ensure long-term sustainability of these invaluable regions.
