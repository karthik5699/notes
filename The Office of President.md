# The Office of President

- Introduction
	- The President of India serves as the **head of state** and a **nominal executive** within the country's parliamentary system
	- The office symbolizes the unity, integrity, and solidarity of the nation.
	- Article 52 establishes the office of the President.
	- The President is generally required to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers (Article 74)
- Why do we need a President?
	- In a parliamentary system, the council of ministers is dependent on the support of the majority in legislature.
	- This means that the council of ministers may be removed at any time and a new council of ministers will have to be put in place.
	- Such a situation requires a Head of the state who has a fixed term, who maybe empowered to appoint the Prime Minister and who may symbolically represent the entire country.
- Appointment
	- The President is indirectly elected for a five-year term by an electoral college, which includes elected members of both Houses of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of the States and Union Territories (Delhi, Puducherry and J&K)
	- The election uses a system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote
	- The system of indirect election was criticised by some as falling short of the democratic ideal underlying universal adult franchise, but indirect election was supported by the framers of the constitution on the following grounds:
		- Direct election by a vast electorate would mean an enormous loss of time, energy and money
		- In a parliamentary democracy real power rests with the council of ministers, so it would be anomalous to elect the President directly without giving him real powers
- Powers and Functions
	- The President is primarily a constitutional head of state, exercising powers with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister
	- Executive Powers
		- The President appoints the Prime Minister, and other ministers are appointed on the Prime Minister's advice (Article 75)
		- The President also appoints State Governors and Lieutenant Governors
		- The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and other Election Commissioners
		- The President appoints the Comptroller and Auditor General and receives audit reports from the CAG
		- Appoints Supreme Court and High Court judges after consultation with relevant judges
		- He can appoint a commission to investigate into conditions of SCs, STs and other backward classes
	- Legislative Powers
		- Addresses Parliament at start of first session each year
		- Summons, prorogues, dissolves Parliament
		- Assent to bills (ordinary, money, constitutional amendment)
		- Ordinance-making power under Article 123.
			- In <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Cooper case (1970)</mark>, the Supreme Court held that the President's satisfaction can be questioned in a court on the ground of malafide.
	- Emergency Powers
		- National Emergency (Article 352): 
			- Can proclaim a state of emergency if national security is threatened by war, external aggression, or armed rebellion
		- President's Rule (Article 356): 
			- Can dismiss a state government and assume its functions if the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution, based on a Governor's report
		- Financial Emergency (Article 360): 
			- Can issue a proclamation if the financial stability or credit of India or any part is threatened
	- Pardoning Power: 
		- The President has the power to grant pardon, reprieve, respite, remission, or commutation in respect of punishment by sentence of a court-martial
	- Military Power
		- The Supreme command of the defence forces is vested in the President and the exercise thereof shall be regulated by law
	- Discretionary Powers
		- In case no leader has a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, the President has to decide whom to appoint as the Prime Minister.
		- Since the rise of coalition politics after 1989, the importance of presidential office has increased. 
-  Limitations
	- Binding Nature of Advice: 
		- The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, made the President bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers. 
		- The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, allowed the President to request reconsideration of such advice once, but the reconsidered advice became binding
	- Constitutional Conventions: 
		- Despite provisions that could be interpreted to grant substantial power, constitutional conventions have largely established the President as a figurehead, with real executive power vested in the Ministry
	- Parliamentary Control: 
		- All Presidential actions, especially during emergencies, are subject to legislative ratification
	- Judicial Review: 
		- The Supreme Court has asserted its role in reviewing the legality of Presidential actions, especially in matters like President's Rule
