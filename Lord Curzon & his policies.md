# Lord Curzon & his policies

![[Pasted image 20250618163249.png]]

Lord Curzon's policies as Viceroy of India (1899-1905) were characterized by a strong imperialistic approach aimed at consolidating British power and suppressing nascent nationalist aspirations. 

Key Policy Measures:
- Curzon focused on enhancing official control over local administrative bodies
- He appointed a Police Commission in 1902 to review police administration
- Curzon spearheaded the appointment of a Universities Commission in 1902 and the enactment of the Indian Universities Act of 1904
	- his underlying objective was to restrict education and instil loyalty to the British Government among the educated Indian populace
- He firmly rejected the prospect of self-government for India and justified British rule by framing it as "the White Man’s burden" to civilize a "barbaric people"
- His administration implemented measures like the Official Secrets Act (1904) and the Calcutta Corporation Act (1899), which were perceived as tools to curb dissent and undermine Indian political activity
	- OSA was seen as a direct attack on the **freedom of press and expression**
	- CCA curtailed Indian representation in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation
- In 1903, he wrote to the Madras Governor: ‘My policy, ever since I came to India, has been to reduce the Congress to impotence.’
	- Curzon's dismissive attitude towards the Moderates & the Congress paved way for the rise of extremist leaders
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The Partition of Bengal (1905)</mark>: This was the most contentious policy and a watershed moment for the national movement.
	- Curzon's stated administrative reasons were seen as a pretext; the real motivation was political: to diminish the influence of Bengali politicians and undermine Indian nationalism by dividing the Bengali population along linguistic and religious lines
	- Bengal was the nerve center of Indian Nationalism at the time. ‘Bengal united, is power, Bengal divided, will pull several different ways.'
	- The partition was condemned unanimously by Indian nationalists. It ignited the Swadeshi and Boycott Movement.


In summary, Lord Curzon's policies, driven by an imperialistic desire to consolidate power and maintain British dominance, inadvertently catalyzed and radicalized the Indian national movement. 

His administrative strictures, educational controls, and most significantly, the Partition of Bengal, fostered a widespread disillusionment with British rule and spurred a more assertive, mass-based anti-colonial struggle, setting the stage for future phases of nationalism.
