## Questions:

1. Trace the rise and growth of socio--religious reform movements with special reference to young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj.

# Socio-religious reform movements

The socio-religious reform movements emerged in India in the early 19th century, driven by a new vision among enlightened sections of Indian society.

The reform movements could broadly be classified into two categories—the reformist movements like the Brahmo Samaj, the Prarthana Samaj, the Aligarh Movement, and the revivalist movements like Arya Samaj and the Deoband movement.

- The Brahmo Samaj
	- Raja Ram Mohan Roy Phase (1828–1833)
		- Raja Rammohan Roy, often called the "father of Indian Renaissance" and "maker of Modern India," founded the Brahmo Sabha in 1828, later renamed Brahmo Samaj
		- Roy believed in a modern scientific approach, human dignity, and social equality
		- He translated the Vedas and Upanishads to support his view that ancient Hindu texts upheld monotheism
		- The long-term agenda of the Brahmo Samaj was to purify Hinduism and to preach monotheism. 
		- The Samaj also tried to incorporate teachings of other religions and kept its emphasis on human dignity, opposition to idolatry and criticism of social evils such as sati, caste system.
		- Promoted women’s rights, especially education and widow remarriage
	- Debendranath Tagore Phase (1843–1857)
		- A scholar and reformer; father of Rabindranath Tagore
		- Revived Brahmo Samaj in 1843 by joining with his followers from Tattwabodhini Sabha 
		- Introduced Brahmo Dharma—a moral-spiritual code rooted in Upanishads
		- Opposed polytheism, image worship, and emphasized inner spiritual development
		- The movement became more structured, scriptural, and disciplined under his leadership
	- Keshab Chandra Sen Phase (1857–1866)
		- Joined in 1857; brought dynamism, charisma, and nationwide outreach
		- Emphasised **universal religion**—inspired by Christianity and other faiths.
		- Advocated social reforms like inter-caste marriage, widow remarriage, and girls' education
		- However, his radical views caused tensions with Debendranath
		- Result: Split into two branches:
			- Adi Brahmo Samaj (Debendranath): Traditional, Upanishadic monotheism
			- Brahmo Samaj of India (Keshab): Reformist, inclusive and universalist
- Young Bengal Movement
	- During the late 1820s and early 1830s, a radical intellectual trend emerged among Bengal's youth, known as the 'Young Bengal Movement'
	- Led and inspired by Henry Vivian Derozio, an Anglo-Indian teacher at Hindu College
	- Derozio inspired his pupils to think freely and rationally, question all authority, love liberty, equality and freedom, and oppose decadent customs and traditions
	- Derozio is considered perhaps the first nationalist poet of modern India
	- The Derozians failed to have a long-term impact primarily due to prevailing social conditions that were not yet ripe for radical ideas
	- Despite limitations, they continued Rammohan Roy's tradition of public education on social, economic, and political issues
- Satyashodhak Samaj
	- Jyotiba Phule, born in Maharashtra, belonged to the mali (gardener) community and organised a powerful movement against upper caste domination and brahminical supremacy
	- Phule founded the Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth Seekers’ Society) in 1873
	- The main aims of the movement were
		- social service
		- spread of education among women and lower caste people.
	- Phule’s works, Sarvajanik Satyadharma and Gulamgiri, became sources of inspiration for the common masses. Phule used the symbol of Rajah Bali as opposed to the brahmins’ symbol of Rama.
	- He was a pioneer of widow remarriage movement in Maharashtra and also opened a home for widows in 1854.
	- Phule was awarded the title ‘Mahatma’ for his social reform work.
- Ramakrishna Movement
	- Two objectives of the Ramakrishna movement were
		- to spread the universal message of Vedanta
		- to undertake preaching, philanthropic, and charitable work with the belief that all human beings are manifestations of the Divine
	- Ramakrishna Paramahamsa recognised the fundamental oneness of all religions
		- “As many faiths, so many paths.”
	- “Service of man is the service of God.”
	- Swami Vivekananda spread Ramakrishna’s message and tried to reconcile it to the needs of contemporary Indian society
	- He subscribed to the Vedanta which he considered a fully rational system
	- At the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893, Swami Vivekananda made a great impression
		- The keynote of his opening address was the need for a healthy balance between spiritualism and materialism.
	- In India he delivered a series of lectures, the focus of which were to infuse into the new generation a sense of pride in India’s past, a new faith in India’s culture, and a rare sense of confidence in India’s future
	- In 1897 he founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Vivekananda was a great humanist and used the Ramakrishna Mission for humanitarian relief and social work
- Aligarh Movement
	- Led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in the late 19th century to uplift the Muslim community socially, educationally, and politically after the 1857 revolt.
	- Emphasised modern education, especially Western science and rationalism, along with Islamic values.
	- Founded the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College in 1875 at Aligarh, which later became Aligarh Muslim University (1920)
	- Promoted English education and discouraged traditional madrasa learning that did not adapt to modern times
	- Encouraged Muslims to cooperate with the British for progress and avoid involvement in active politics
	- Opposed the Indian National Congress initially, fearing it would not safeguard Muslim interests

Significance of Reform Movements
- The reform movements gave the rising middle classes the much needed cultural roots to cling to, and served the purpose of reducing the sense of humiliation which the conquest by a foreign power had produced.

Negative Aspects
- The reformers’ focus on past glory and religious scriptures often promoted mystical beliefs in new forms and encouraged pseudo-scientific ideas
- it also widened divisions between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Parsis, and further separated high caste and low caste Hindus
- The process of evolution of a composite culture which was evident throughout Indian history showed signs of being arrested with the rise of another form of consciousness— communal consciousness—along with national consciousness among the middle classes
	- Many other factors were certainly responsible for the birth of communalism in modern times, but undoubtedly the nature of religious reform movements also contributed to it.
