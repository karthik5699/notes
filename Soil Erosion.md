## Questions:



# Soil Erosion

- Soil erosion is the loosening and displacement of topsoil from the land due to the action of agents like wind and water
- Soil erosion in nature may be a slow process (geological erosion) or a fast process promoted by human activities like overgrazing, deforestation
- Weathering and erosion lead to the simultaneous process of ‘degradation’ and ‘aggradation’.
- Erosion is a mobile process while weathering is a static process

- Water Erosion
	- Running water is one of the main agents, which carries away soil particles
	- Erosion by water is termed differently according to the intensity and nature of erosion:
		- Raindrop Erosion
			- Raindrops behave like tiny bombs when falling on exposed soil, displace soil particles and destroy soil structure
		- Sheet Erosion
			- With continued rainfall the displaced soil particles fill in the spaces between soil particles and prevent water from seeping into the soil. 
			- This results in surface runoff and even more erosion
		- Rill and Gully Erosion
			- In rill erosion finger like rills appear on the cultivated land after it has undergone sheet erosion
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701162341.png]]
			- These rills are usually smoothened out every year while forming
			- When rills increase in size, they become gullies.
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701162727.png]]
			- Once started, gullies will continue to move by headward erosion or by slumping of the side walls
			- Gullies formed over a large area gives rise to badland topography (Chambal Ravines)
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701163418.png]]
			- When a gully bed is eroded further due to headward erosion, the bed gradually deepens and flattens out, and a **ravine** is formed
			- Further erosion of ravine beds gives rise to canyons (Grand Canyon on Colorado River)
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701163732.png]]
		- Stream bank Erosion
			- The erosion of soil from the banks (shores) of the streams or rivers due to the flowing water
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701164054.png]]
			- Stream bank erosion damages the adjoining agricultural lands, highways and bridges
		- Landslides
			- The sudden mass movement of soil is called a landslide
			- Occur due to instability or loss of balance of land mass with respect to gravity due to excessive water or moisture in the earth mass
			- ![[Pasted image 20250701164428.png]]
			- Gravity acts on such an unstable landmass and causes the large chunks of surface materials such as soil and rocks to slide down rapidly.
		- Coastal Erosion
			- In the coastal areas, waves dash along the coast and cause heavy damage to the soil
		- Glacial Erosion
			- In the polar regions and high mountainous regions like the Himalayas, soil erosion is caused by slowly moving glaciers
			- Glaciers exert immense pressure and have tremendous erosive power due to their sheer weight and slow, persistent movement

- Wind Erosion
	- Wind erosion or aeolian erosion is quite significant in arid and semi-arid regions due to absence of physical obstruction
	- These winds remove the fertile, arable, loose soils leaving behind a depression devoid of topsoil.
	- The depression formation in deserts is the first step in Oasis formation.


## Personal Analysis:

Chambal Ravines -> Alluvial soils (often loosely bound and susceptible to erosion)
