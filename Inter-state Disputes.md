# Inter-state Disputes

- Introduction
	- India's federal structure, which accommodates diverse socio-political and economic interests among its states, inevitably gives rise to inter-state disputes. 
	- To manage these conflicts and maintain cooperative federalism, the Indian Constitution and subsequent legislation have established several mechanisms for dispute resolution
- Constitutional and Legal Frameworks
	- Original Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (Article 131):
		- Article 131 grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between the Government of India and one or more states, or between two or more states
	- Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956 (Article 262)
		- Article 262 empowers Parliament to legislate for the adjudication of disputes related to the waters of inter-state rivers and river valleys. 
		- Crucially, this article bars the Supreme Court's jurisdiction in such disputes once a tribunal is constituted under the enabling law
		- Prominent tribunals have addressed disputes over the Cauvery (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry), Krishna (Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka), Godavari, Ravi-Beas
		- The absence of a permanent mechanism means ad hoc tribunals lack continuity and institutional memory
	- River Boards Act, 1956: 
		- This act allows for the establishment of River Boards for the regulation and development of inter-state rivers
		- Not a single river board has ever been constituted.
	- Finance Commission
		- Fiscal Federalism: 
			- Appointed regularly by the President every five years, the Finance Commission makes recommendations regarding the distribution of taxes between the Centre and the states, and among the states themselves
-  Institutional Mechanisms
	- Inter-State Council (ISC):
		- Established under Article 263 of the Constitution, based on the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission, to investigate and discuss subjects of common interest to states or between the Union and states
		- Composition and Functions: 
			- Chaired by the Prime Minister, it includes Chief Ministers and select Union Cabinet Ministers. It serves as a forum for dialogue, policy coordination, and discussing inter-state conflicts
		- Limitations: 
			- The ISC has been politically underutilized and has not fully realized its potential as a forum for cooperative federalism. 
			- Its meetings are infrequent, reducing its ability to address issues in real-time
	- NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India):
		- Replaced the Planning Commission in 2015, NITI Aayog claims to promote a "Team India" spirit and foster collaborative policymaking through its Governing Council, which engages Chief Ministers
		- Despite structural inclusion, NITI Aayog lacks constitutional status and financial allocation powers, unlike its predecessor. 
		- It is often perceived as a Centre-dominated forum.
	- GST Council:
		- Created by the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act in 2016, this federal body comprises Union and State Finance Ministers and decides on indirect tax policy and revenue-sharing
		- It is lauded as a successful model of fiscal cooperative federalism, institutionalizing regular Union-State dialogue and joint decision-making
	- Zonal Councils:
		- These statutory bodies, established under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, promote regional cooperation and conflict resolution among states
		- Despite their potential, Zonal Councils remain underutilized
- Territorial Disputes
	- Historical and linguistic reasons for demarcation have led to inter-state border disputes, such as: Assam–Nagaland, Maharashtra–Karnataka (Belgaum), and Assam–Mizoram.
	- These are typically adjudicated by the Supreme Court or resolved politically
- Inter-state water disputes challenges
	- **Water as a State Subject**: 
		- Under India's federal structure, water falls primarily under the State List, making national commitments highly contingent on sub-national approval
	- Asymmetry of Power: 
		- The Union government wields disproportionate powers in water management through bodies like the Central Water Commission and the Ministry of Jal Shakti, despite water being a state subject. 
		- This unitary tilt can raise suspicions of bias among states, undermining the ethos of cooperative federalism
		- Similarly, upper riparian states inherently possess a structural advantage over downstream states
- Challenges and Future Directions
	- Overall, while India's mechanisms for inter-state dispute resolution provide vital avenues for redress, their effectiveness is often hampered by procedural delays, political resistance, and enforcement limitations
	- To enhance their efficacy, reforms are imperative
		- Establishing permanent, independent federal dispute resolution bodies.
		- Strengthening the role and institutional autonomy of the Inter-State Council, with regular meetings and enhanced policy powers.
		- Introducing time-bound mechanisms for tribunals and judicial resolution
		- Promoting pre-litigation dialogue and empowering zonal councils to mediate emerging tensions
- Conclusion
	- A renewed commitment to **cooperative federalism**, characterized by good faith, transparency, and mutual respect between the Union and states, is essential for these mechanisms to effectively serve national unity and democratic legitimacy
