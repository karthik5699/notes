## Questions:

1. Give a geographical explanation of the distribution of off-shore oil reserves of the world. How are they different from the on-shore occurrences of oil reserves?

# On-shore vs. Off-shore oil reserves

- Introduction
	- While onshore reserves occur within continental interiors and margins, offshore reserves are concentrated on continental shelves and margins beneath the seabed
- Geographical Distribution of Offshore Oil Reserves:
	- Middle East & Persian Gulf: 
		- Giant shallow offshore fields like <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Safaniya</mark> (Saudi Arabia) dominate, reflecting the same geological history as onshore reserves of Arabia
	- Latin America: 
		- Brazil’s Santos Basin and Guyana–Suriname Basin represent major deepwater discoveries
	- West Africa: 
		- Nigeria, Angola, and Ghana host significant deepwater fields
	- North America: 
		- The Gulf of Mexico is a mature yet prolific offshore region, producing from both shallow and deepwater.
	- Europe: 
		- The North Sea (UK, Norway) exemplifies mature offshore fields
	- Asia-Pacific: 
		- Offshore fields are found in the South China Sea, Bohai Bay, Malaysia, and offshore Australia
- Overall, offshore oil contributes about **30% of global oil production**, with deepwater and ultra-deepwater fields becoming increasingly important as shallow fields mature
- Differences from Onshore Occurrences:
	- Onshore reserves are often in large continental sedimentary basins; offshore reserves lie under continental shelves and margins.
	- Onshore oil is relatively easier and cheaper to extract; offshore requires advanced technology, floating rigs, and subsea pipelines
	- Offshore extraction is capital-intensive, with higher environmental risks (oil spills, marine ecosystem impact).
	- Onshore basins are relatively mature; future discoveries are increasingly offshore, especially in deepwater.
- Conclusion
	- Offshore oil reserves, though technologically and financially demanding, are emerging as critical frontiers of global energy security, complementing the more accessible but declining onshore reserves.
