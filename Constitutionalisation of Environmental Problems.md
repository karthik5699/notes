## Questions:

1. “The most significant achievement of modern law in India is the constitutionalization of environmental problems by the Supreme Court.” Discuss this statement with the help of relevant case laws.

# Constitutionalisation of Environmental Problems

- Introduction
	- By creatively interpreting **Article 21 (Right to Life)**, alongside **Article 48A** and **Article 51A(g)**, the Supreme Court has recognized a clean and healthy environment as intrinsic to life with dignity.
- Case laws
	- M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (Oleum Gas Leak, 1986)
		- Gave birth to the doctrine of **absolute liability** for hazardous industries
	- Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar (1991)
		- Court held that the right to life includes the right to pollution-free water and air.
	- Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India (1996)
		- Recognized Precautionary Principle & Polluter Pays Principle as part of Article 21
	- M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath (1997)
		- Introduced the **Public Trust Doctrine**: State is a trustee of natural resources
	- T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India (1997 onwards, Forest Case)
		- Expanded definition of forests, brought judicial oversight over deforestation, and created the tool of **continuing mandamus**
- Significance
	- Elevated environment to a fundamental right.
	- Enabled **Public Interest Litigations (PILs)** for citizens
- Challenges
	- **Separation of Powers and Judicial Overreach:** 
		- Courts are often accused of encroaching upon executive and legislative domains
	- **Implementation Deficit:** 
		- Judicial orders depend on the executive machinery for implementation
		- This often creates a wide gap between judicial pronouncements and ground reality, as seen in the persistent pollution of the Ganga.
	- **Lack of Technical Expertise:** 
		- Judges, being legal experts, lack scientific and technical knowledge required for complex environmental issues
- Conclusion
	- The Supreme Court has ensured that environmental protection is not merely a policy option but a constitutional entitlement.
	- While judicial intervention is vital, its effectiveness is constrained by these limits, highlighting the need for specialized bodies like the **National Green Tribunal (NGT)** to bridge the gap.
