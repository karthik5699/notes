# Long road to Social Justice

Social justice in India refers to the pursuit of an equitable and inclusive society by dismantling historical hierarchies based on caste, gender, religion, and class.

- Ancient and Early Philosophical Foundations
	- **Vedic Age**: The Varna system emerged as a functional division but later turned into a rigid caste structure.
	- Buddhism and Jainism (6th century BCE):
		- Rejected ritualism and caste hierarchy.
		- Buddha promoted universal brotherhood and dignity
- Bhakti and Sufi Movements (8th–17th Century)
	- Bhakti Saints: Kabir, Basavanna, Tukaram, and Mirabai emphasized devotion over birth, and vernacular accessibility over Sanskrit elitism.
	- Sufi Saints: Preached egalitarianism, love, and rejection of orthodoxy.
	- These movements questioned Brahmanical dominance, but lacked institutional mechanisms to ensure justice.
- Colonial Period Social Reform
	- Reformers like Jyotiba Phule, Periyar, and B.R. Ambedkar launched organized resistance
		- Satyashodhak Samaj and Self-Respect Movement.
		- Ambedkar’s fight against untouchability and for Dalit rights marked a modern articulation of social justice.
- Post-Independence Constitutional Framework
	- Articles 14–17 of the Constitution enshrine equality, non-discrimination, and abolition of untouchability.
	- Reservation policies, Mandal Commission, and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (1989) created institutional tools for justice


The evolution of social justice in India reflects a shift from religious reforms to constitutional affirmation. From Buddha’s renunciation of caste, through Bhakti’s devotional equality, to Ambedkar’s legal safeguards, we have come a long way in our march towards an equitable and inclusive society.
