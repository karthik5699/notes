## Questions:



# Public Resource Mobilisation

- Introduction
	- Public resource mobilisation is the process by which the government raises money—mainly through taxes, borrowing, and non-tax revenues—to fund development and welfare
- Tax Revenue
	- Taxation is the primary instrument for government resource mobilisation
	- The GST Regime
		- GST was a landmark reform aimed at creating a unified national market.
		- While it has improved formalization and revenue buoyancy for states, its reform agenda remains unfinished.
		- Key structural issues include:
			- Exclusion of Key Items: 
				- Petroleum products, electricity, and alcohol remain outside the GST ambit, breaking the value chain and cascading taxes
			- Complex Rate Structure: 
				- The multiple-rate structure complicates compliance and leads to classification disputes.

	- Analyzing India’s Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio
		- A key challenge for India has been its low Tax-to-GDP ratio. 
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">India’s tax-to-GDP ratio stands at 11.7% (2024), much lower than the OECD average of 34.3% and the emerging market average of 20-25%.</mark>
		- Key Reasons for India’s Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio:
			- Around 50% of India’s GDP is from the informal sector, which remains largely untaxed, limiting the tax base.
			- Various tax exemptions in sectors like agriculture and exports reduce the overall tax revenue.
			- With a per capita income around $2,600 in FY25, the tax-paying base remains limited
			- Tax evasion and administrative inefficiencies reduce the effectiveness of the tax system.
			- Indirect taxes (e.g., GST) contribute significantly to the tax revenue (5% of GDP) but are less progressive, limiting their effectiveness in capturing income from higher earners.
		- A low ratio limits the government's fiscal capacity to invest in infrastructure and social sectors
	- However, there has been a recent rise in the tax-to-GDP ratio due to improvements in direct tax collection, tax reforms, and better compliance, signalling a positive shift in India's tax system.
- Non-Tax Revenue
	- Disinvestment as a Strategic Tool
		- Disinvestment, or the sale of government equity in Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), has evolved from being a purely revenue-raising exercise to a strategic policy tool.
		- Under the "New PSE Policy", the government aims to maintain only a "bare minimum" presence in strategic sectors while privatizing or closing PSEs in non- strategic sectors. 
		- It is intended to improve efficiency, unlock capital, and allow the government to exit non-core areas.
		- Asset Monetisation Plan
			- Union Budget 2025 announced India’s Asset Monetization Plan 2025-30, a strategic approach to leverage the existing public infrastructure assets and create non-tax revenue to reinvest in new infrastructure projects.

			- Key Challenges
				- Challenges in Asset Valuation: 
					- Assessing the fair market worth of various assets is intricate, which may result in undervaluation or overvaluation
				- Regulatory and Policy Challenges:
					- Prolonged approval procedures and varying regulations among sectors may postpone transactions
	- The Role of Dividends from PSUs and RBI Surplus Transfer
		- Other significant sources of non-tax revenue include dividends paid by profitable PSUs and the transfer of surplus profits from the RBI to the government
		- RBI has approved a bumper surplus transfer, or dividend, of Rs 2.69 lakh crore to the Central Government for FY 2024-25.
- Public Borrowing and Fiscal Management
	- Balancing Growth Imperatives with Fiscal Sustainability:
		- Government borrowing is a key tool to finance fiscal deficits. 
		- However, high levels of public debt can pose risks to macroeconomic stability by increasing interest burdens and potentially crowding out private investment.
		- The central challenge is to manage this debt while continuing to fund economic growth.
		- This is particularly relevant in the post-pandemic era where most countries, including India, have seen a surge in public debt.
		- The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, provides a legislative framework for ensuring fiscal prudence by setting targets for fiscal and revenue deficits. 
		- The central government aims to make debt-GDP ratio a new fiscal anchor from FY27 and aim to reduce the central debt ratio to 50% by 2031
	- Debt-GDP ratio:
		- Central Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio (FY 2024-25): 57.1%
		- General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio (including states): ~80– 81%.
		- India’s debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate compared to advanced economies like the USA, but higher than many emerging markets
		- Rationale behind shifting towards Debt-GDP ratio:
			- Traditionally, India’s fiscal rules (under FRBM Act, 2003) used **fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio** as the main anchor.
			- N.K. Singh committee had suggested using debt as the primary target for fiscal policy because:
				- Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability: 
					- The debt-to-GDP ratio provides a more comprehensive measure of a country’s fiscal health, focusing on the sustainability of government borrowing over time rather than just annual flows.
				- Greater Policy Flexibility: 
					- It allows governments to respond to economic shocks (such as recessions or pandemics) with counter-cyclical spending, without being constrained by rigid annual fiscal deficit targets.
				- Improved Transparency and Accountability: 
					- By including off-budget borrowings and contingent liabilities, the debt-to-GDP ratio offers a clearer and more transparent picture of total government obligations, improving public finance management.
				- Alignment with Global Best Practices: 
					- Many advanced economies use the debt-to-GDP ratio as a fiscal anchor, aligning India’s fiscal framework with international standards and boosting investor confidence. E.g., EU, Germany.
- Public Investment as a Growth Catalyst for Resource Mobilisation
	- Infrastructure: 
		- The Union Budget 2025-26 has allocated a historic ₹11.21 Lakh crore (3.1% of India’s GDP) for capital expenditure, focusing on comprehensive infrastructure development under initiatives like PM Gati Shakti.
	- Clean and Nuclear Energy: 
		- There is a strong push towards sustainable energy. 
		- The budget provides viability gap funding for offshore wind energy projects, support for the e-vehicle ecosystem, and a new scheme for biomass aggregation machinery.
		- A new Nuclear Energy Mission has been launched with a ₹20,000 crore outlay for R&D in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). 
		- The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana aims to solarise 1 crore households
	- Agriculture and Housing: 
		- To support the farm sector, the budget allocated ₹20 lakh crore for agricultural credit and established an Agriculture Accelerator Fund.
		- The PM Awas Yojana aims to build 30 million affordable rural houses and address the needs of 1 crore urban poor families.
	- R&D Challenge: 
		- India's expenditure on R&D is only about 0.7% of GDP, far below peers like China (2.4%). 
		- The private sector's contribution is particularly low, at just 37% of the total R&D spending.
		- To address this, the Union Budget has allocated ₹20,000 crore to the Ministry of Science and Technology to boost innovation.
