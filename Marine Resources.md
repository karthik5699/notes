# Marine Resources

- Introduction
	- Marine resources refer to the natural wealth derived from oceans and seas, encompassing a vast range of living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) materials
- Types of Marine Resources
	- Biotic Resources (Living Resources)
		- Fish and shellfish: 
			- Provide protein-rich food to billions and are a major source of employment
		- Seaweeds and algae: 
			- Used in food additives, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and fertilizers
		- Corals and sponges: 
			- Source of calcium carbonate, natural habitat for biodiversity, and useful in medical research.
	- Abiotic Resources (Non-Living Resources)
		- Minerals: 
			- Such as polymetallic nodules (rich in manganese, nickel, cobalt), sand, and gravel
		- Salt: 
			- Extracted through evaporation of seawater, crucial for human consumption and industries
	- Energy Resources
		- Offshore oil and natural gas: 
			- Major source of energy; Indiaâ€™s Mumbai High and KG Basin are notable reserves
		- Tidal and wave energy: 
			- Renewable and predictable, though yet to be fully tapped
- Threats to Marine Resources
	- Overfishing: 
		- Leads to collapse of fish populations and loss of livelihoods
	- Marine Pollution: 
		- From plastic waste, oil spills, sewage, and industrial runoff.
	- Habitat Destruction: 
		- Mangroves, coral reefs, and estuaries are being degraded rapidly.
	- Climate Change: 
		- Ocean warming, sea level rise, and acidification affect marine life and ecosystems.
	- Deep-sea Mining: 
		- May lead to irreversible ecological damage if not regulated properly
- Initiatives for Conservation of Marine Resources
	- In India:
		- Deep Ocean Mission: 
			- Focuses on developing technologies for deep ocean exploration and sustainable use
		- National Fisheries Policy: 
			- Promotes conservation, modern practices, and reduces post harvest losses.
		- Sagarmala Programme: 
			- Promotes port-led development and deep ocean exploration
		- PM Matsya Sampada Yojana: 
			- Encourages sustainable fisheries and aquaculture
		- Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2019: 
			- Protects coastal areas and marine waters by regulating activities
	- Global Initiatives:
		- SDG 14 (Life Below Water): 
			- Calls for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and marine resources.
		- UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea): 
			- Provides a legal framework for ocean governance.
		- Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD): 
			- Addresses conservation of marine species and habitats
