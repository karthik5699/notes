# Atmospheric Pressure Belts and Wind Systems

Pressure Systems
- Air expands when heated and gets compressed when cooled. This results in variations in the atmospheric pressure.
- The differences in atmospheric pressure causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure, setting the air in motion. Atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink.
- Air in horizontal motion is wind. The wind redistributes the heat and moisture across latitudes, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole
- The vertical rising of moist air forms clouds and bring precipitation

Air Pressure
- Since air has mass, it also has weight. 
- The pressure of air at a given place is defined as a force exerted in all directions by virtue of the weight of all the air above it.

Vertical Variation of Pressure
- In the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height.
- The decrease in pressure with altitude, however, is not constant. Since the factors controlling air density – temperature, amount of water vapour and gravity are variable, there is no simple relationship between altitude and pressure.
- The vertical pressure gradient force is much larger than that of the horizontal pressure gradient. But, it is generally balanced by a nearly equal but opposite gravitational force. Hence, we do not experience strong upward winds.
- Due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure. Since air pressure is proportional to density as well as temperature, it follows that a change in either temperature or density will cause a corresponding change in the pressure.
	- P=ρ⋅R⋅T 
		- ρ = Density
- The pressure decreases with height. At any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.

- A rising pressure indicates fine, settled weather, while a falling pressure indicates unstable and cloudy weather. 
	- Pressure **at your location** is **increasing over time** → Clear weather
	- Pressure at your location is decreasing over time → Cloudy or rainy weather

Horizontal Distribution of Pressure
- Horizontal distribution of pressure is studied by drawing isobars at constant levels.
- Isobars are lines connecting places having equal pressure. In order to eliminate the effect of altitude on pressure, it is measured at any station after being reduced to sea level for purposes of comparison
- The spacing of isobars expresses the rate and direction of pressure changes and is referred to as pressure gradient.
- Close spacing of isobars indicates a steep or strong pressure gradient, while wide spacing suggests weak gradient. 
- There are distinctly identifiable zones of homogeneous horizontal pressure regimes or ‘pressure belts’. On the earth’s surface, there are in all seven pressure belts.
- ![[Pasted image 20250705135335.png]]


World Distribution of Sea Level Pressure
- Near the equator the sea level pressure is low and the area is known as equatorial low. 
- Along 30° N and 30° S are found the high-pressure areas known as the subtropical highs.
- Further pole wards along 60° N and 60° S, the low-pressure belts are termed as the sub polar lows. 
- Near the poles the pressure is high and it is known as the polar high.
- These pressure belts are not permanent in nature. They oscillate with the apparent movement of the sun. 
	- In the northern hemisphere in winter they move southwards and in the summer northwards.

#### Equatorial Low Pressure Belt or ‘Doldrums’
- Lies between 10°N and 10°S latitudes.
- Width may vary between 5°N and 5°S and 20°N and 20°S.
- This belt happens to be the zone of convergence of trade winds from two hemispheres from sub-tropical high pressure belts.
- This belt is also called the Doldrums, because of the extremely calm air movements
- ![[Pasted image 20250705140610.png]]
- The position of the belt varies with the apparent movement of the Sun
- Formation
	- As this region lies along the equator, it receives highest amount of insolation.
	- Due to intense heating, air gets warmed up and rises over the equatorial region (convection).
	- Whenever there is vertically upward movement of air, the region at the surface will be at low pressure. Thus the belt along the equator is called equatorial low pressure belt.
- Climate
	- This belt is characterized by extremely low pressure with calm conditions
	- This is because of the absence of Surface winds since winds approaching this belt begin to rise near its margin. Thus, only vertical currents are found.
	- As the larger part of the low pressure belt passes along the oceans, the winds obtain huge amount of moisture.
	- Vertical winds (convection) carrying moisture form cumulonimbus clouds and lead to thunderstorms (convectional rainfall)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705141018.png]]
	- Inspite of high temperatures, cyclones are not formed at the equator because of ‘zero’ coriolis force

#### Sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt or Horse Latitudes
- The sub-tropical highs extend from near the tropics to about 35°N and S
- Formation
	- After saturation (complete loss of moisture) at the ITCZ, the air moving away from equatorial low pressure belt in the upper troposphere becomes dry and cold
	- This dry and cold wind subsides at 30°N and S.
	- So the high pressure along this belt is due to subsidence of air coming from the equatorial region which descends after becoming heavy
	- The high pressure is also due to the blocking effect of air at upper levels because of the Coriolis force
- Climate
	- The subsiding air is warm and dry, therefore, most of the deserts are present along this belt, in both hemispheres.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705142042.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705142201.png]]
	- A calm condition (anticyclonic) with feeble winds is created in this high pressure belt.
	- The descending air currents feed the winds blowing towards adjoining low pressure belts
	- This belt is frequently invaded by tropical and extra-tropical disturbances
- Horse Latitudes
	- The corresponding latitudes of sub-tropical high pressure belt are called horse latitudes. 
	- In early days, the sailing vessels with cargo of horses found it difficult to sail under calm conditions of this high pressure belt.
	- They used to throw horses into the sea when fodder ran out. Hence the name horse latitudes.

#### Sub-Polar Low Pressure Belt
- Located between 45°N and S latitudes and the Arctic and the Antarctic circles (66.5° N and S latitudes).
- Owning to low temperatures in these latitudes the sub polar low pressure belts are not very well pronounced year long
- On long-term mean climatic maps, the sub polar low-pressure belts of the northern hemisphere are grouped into two centers of atmospheric activity: the Iceland low and the Aleutian depression (Aleutian low)
	- they are areas where storms often form.
- Formation
	- These are dynamically produced due to
		- Coriolis Force produced by rotation of the earth on its axis, and.
		- Ascent of air as a result of convergence of westerlies and polar easterlies
- Climate
	- The area of contrast between cold and warm air masses produces polar jet streams which encircles the earth at 60 degrees latitudes and is focused in these low pressure areas.
	- Due to a great contrast between the temperatures of the winds from sub-tropical and polar source regions, extra tropical cyclonic storms or lows’ (temperate cyclones or frontal cyclones) are produced in this region.

#### Polar High Pressure Belt
- The polar highs are small in area and extend around the poles
- They lie around poles between 80 – 90° N and S latitudes.
- Formation
	- The air from sub-polar low pressure belts after saturation becomes dry. This dry air becomes cold while moving towards poles through upper troposphere
	- The cold air (heavy) on reaching poles subsides creating a high pressure belt at the surface of earth
- Climate
	- The lowest temperatures are found over the poles.

#### Pressure belts in July
- In the northern hemisphere, during summer, with the apparent northward shift of the sun, the thermal equator (belt of highest temperature) is located north of the geographical equator.
- The pressure belts shift slightly north of their annual average locations
- ![[Pasted image 20250705145409.png]]

#### Pressure belts in January
- During winter, these conditions are completely reversed and the pressure belts shift south of their annual mean locations.
- The amount of shift is, however, less in the southern hemisphere due to predominance of water.
- ![[Pasted image 20250705150023.png]]
- Similarly, distribution of continents and oceans have a marked influence over the distribution of pressure. In winter, the continents are cooler than the oceans and tend to develop high pressure centres, whereas in summer, they are relatively warmer and develop low pressure. It is just the reverse with the oceans.

Factors Controlling Pressure Systems
- Thermal Factors
	- When air is heated, it expands and, hence, its density decreases. This naturally leads to low pressure. On the contrary, cooling results in contraction. This increases the density and thus leads to high pressure.
	- Formation of equatorial low and polar highs are examples of thermal lows and thermal highs, respectively.
- Dynamic Factors
	- Apart from variations of temperature, the formation of pressure belts may be explained by dynamic controls arising out of pressure gradient forces and rotation of the earth (Coriolis force). 
	- Example
		- After saturation (complete loss of moisture) at the ITCZ, the air moving away from equatorial low pressure belt in the upper troposphere becomes dry and cold. This dry and cold wind subsides at 30°N and S.
		- So the high pressure along this belt is due to subsidence of air coming from the equatorial region which descends after becoming heavy
		- The rate of deflection increases with the distance from the equator (Coriolis force). As a result, by the time the poleward directed winds reach 25° latitude, they are deflected into a nearly west-to-east flow. 
		- It produces a blocking effect and the air piles up. This causes a general subsidence in the areas between the tropics and 35°N and S, and they develop into high pressure belts.
		- The location of pressure belts is further affected by differences in net radiation resulting from apparent movement of the sun and from variations in heating of land and water surfaces
		- Thus formation of sub-tropical high and sub-polar low pressure belts are due to dynamic factors like pressure gradient forces, apparent movement of sun and rotation of the earth (Coriolis force)

#### Factors affecting Wind Movement
- Wind == horizontal movement of air
- Currents == vertical movement of air.
- Sun is the ultimate force that drives winds. 
	- Pressure differences force winds to flow from high pressure are to low pressure area.
	- Pressure differences in turn are caused by unequal heating of the earth’s surface by solar radiation
- The wind at the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force.
- Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the combined effect of three forces – the pressure gradient force, the frictional force and the Coriolis force.
- In addition, the gravitational force acts downwards. Centripetal acceleration produces a circular pattern of flow around centers of high and low pressure.
	- Around low pressure, air curves inward and spins (cyclones).
	- Around high pressure, air curves outward and spins (anticyclones).

#### Pressure Gradient Force and Wind Movement
- The differences in atmospheric pressure produces pressure gradient force.
- The rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient.
- Pressure Gradient Force operates from the high pressure area to a low pressure area and causes wind movement.
- The pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to each other and is weak where the isobars are apart.
- Since a closely spaced gradient implies a steep pressure change, it also indicates a strong wind speed
- The wind direction follows the direction of change of pressure, i.e. perpendicular to the isobars.

#### Coriolis Force and Wind Movement
- The rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind. This force is called the Coriolis force. It has great impact on the direction of wind movement.
- Due to the earth’s rotation, winds do not cross the isobars at right angles as the pressure gradient force directs, but get deflected from their original path.
- This deviation is the result of Coriolis Force
- Due to this effect, winds in the northern hemisphere get deflected to the right of their path and those in the southern hemisphere to their left, following Farrell’s Law
- ![[Pasted image 20250705152327.png]]
- This deflection force does not seem to exist until the air is set in motion and increases with wind velocity, air mass and an increase in latitude
- The <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force</mark> (pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar)
- As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it (cyclonic conditions)
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Why are there no tropical cyclones at the equator?</mark>
	- The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. 
	- At the equator (Coriolis force is zero) wind blows perpendicular to the isobars. The low pressure gets filled instead of getting intensified
	- The winds directly gets uplifted vertically to form thunderstorms.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250705152815.png]]

#### Frictional Force and Wind Movement
- The irregularities of the earth’s surface offer resistance to the wind movement in the form of friction.

#### Centripetal Acceleration
- It acts only on air that is flowing around centers of circulation.
- Centripetal acceleration creates a force directed at right angles to the wind movement and inwards towards the centers of rotation
- This force produces a circular pattern of flow around centers of high and low pressure


### Pressure and Wind: Geostrophic Wind
- The velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces.
- The winds in the upper atmosphere, 2 – 3 km above the surface, are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled by the pressure gradient and the Coriolis force
- When isobars are straight and when there is no friction, the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar. 
- This wind is known as the **geostrophic wind.**
- ![[Pasted image 20250705153827.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250705154458.png]]
- The wind movement around a low is called **cyclonic circulation**. Around a high it is called **anti cyclonic circulation**. The direction of winds around such systems changes according to their location in different hemispheres.
- The wind movement or wind circulation at the earth’s surface around low and high on many occasions is closely related to the wind circulation at higher level. Generally, over low pressure area the air will converge and rise. Over high pressure area the air will subside from above and diverge at the surface.
