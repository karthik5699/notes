# Issues with Judiciary

- Judicial Vacancies
	- As per Ministry of Law there are more than 5,600 vacancies in the judiciary from lower courts to Supreme Court (SC).
	- Between 2006 and 2024, the number of vacancies in the High Courts has increased from 16% to 30%.
	- India has only about 21 judges per million population, compared to 150 in USA
- Massive Case Backlog
	- Supreme Court Case Backlog hits all-time high with 88,000 pending cases (September 2025)
	- As per the Indian Justice Report, 2025, more than half of Indian jails are overcrowded with 76% of prison inmates being under trials.
- Non transparency in listing of cases 
	- CJI is the master of the roster  
	- Arnab Goswami bail plea listed same day, but freelance journalist Siddiqui Kappan's plea was heard after more than 6 months
- Quality of judgements 
	- Bombay HC judge acquitted POCSO accused for absence of skin-to-skin contact
- Lack of inclusivity
	- There have been only 2 Scheduled Caste CJIs so far
	- First woman CJI in over 75 years of existence as Republic in 2027 (Justice B.V Nagarathna)
	- Why women needed?
		- Provide alternative perspective = Sabarimala verdict –> Justice Indu Malhotra, the sole woman judge, wrote dissenting judgement
		- Gender-sensitive judgement = Mathura rape case (1972) –> exposed institutional insensitivity to sexual violence
		- More nuanced perspective in critical cases = LGBTQ rights, marital rape, UCC etc
		- Ensures more women judges are available to fill important posts like NHRC, NCW, etc
