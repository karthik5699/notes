# Offshore Aquifers

- Introduction
	- Offshore aquifers are bodies of rock or sediment located beneath the sea floor that contain freshwater, similar to onshore aquifers
- Key Features of Offshore Aquifers
	- These aquifers have been found globally off the coasts of Australia, China, North America, and South Africa
	- Offshore aquifers are believed to contain approximately 10% of all terrestrial fresh groundwater.
- Significance
	- They represent a potential untapped source of freshwater, especially valuable for water-stressed regions.
	- Could serve as buffers during climate change-induced droughts and erratic rainfall.
	- According to a UN report, global freshwater demand is predicted to exceed supply by 40% by 2030, making offshore aquifers increasingly important.
- Challenges
	- High costs associated with extraction
	- Environmental risks to ocean ecosystems, including marine life
