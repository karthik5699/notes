# Savanna Climate

![[Pasted image 20250716134239.png]]

- Savanna Climate or Tropical Wet and Dry Climate or Sudan Climate
	- This type of climate has alternate wet and dry seasons similar to monsoon climate but has considerably less annual rainfall
	- Also, there is no distinct rainy season like in monsoon climate
	- Only two seasons – winter and summer. Rains occur in summer
	- Floods and droughts are common
- Distribution of Savanna Climate
	- It is confined within the tropics and is best developed in Sudan, hence its name the Sudan Climate.
	- It is a transitional type of climate found between the equatorial rainforests and hot deserts

	- African Savanna
		- The belt includes West African Sudan
	- South American Savanna
		- There are two distinct regions namely the llanos of the Orinoco basin (north of equator) and the Campos of the Brazilian Highlands
- Savanna Climate
	- Rainfall
		- Mean annual rainfall ranges from 80 – 160 cm
	- Temperature
		- Mean annual temperature is greater than 18° C.
		- Highest temperatures do not coincide with the period of the highest sun 
		- Days are hot and nights are cold. This extreme diurnal range of temperature is another characteristic feature of the Sudan type of climate.
	- Winds
		- The prevailing winds of the region are the Trade Winds, which bring rain to the coastal districts
- Natural Vegetation of Savanna Climate
	- ![[Pasted image 20250716135254.png]]
	- The savanna landscape is typified by **tall grass and short trees**
	- The grasslands are also called as ‘bush-veld’
	- The trees are deciduous, shedding their leaves in the cool, dry season to prevent excessive loss of water through transpiration
	- In true savanna lands, the grass is tall and coarse, growing 6 to 12 feet high.
	- As the rainfall diminishes towards the deserts the savanna merges into thorny scrub
- Animal Life of the Savanna
	- The savanna is known as the ‘big game country’ as thousands of animals are trapped or killed each year by people from all over the world.
	- The herbivorous include the zebra, antelope, giraffe, deer, gazelle, elephant etc. (most of the National geographic and Animal Planet documentaries on wild animals are shot in savanna regions) and carnivorous animals include the lion, tiger, leopard, hyena, panther, jaguar, jackal etc
- Life and Economy in the Savanna
	- Many tribes live in savanna region. Tribes like the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Masai</mark> tribes of the East African plateau are pastoralists whereas <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hausa</mark> of northern Nigeria are settled cultivators
	- The cattle kept by the Masai are kept entirely for the supply of milk. They don’t slaughter cattle for meat.
