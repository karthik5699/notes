## Questions:



# Rajya Sabha

- Introduction
	- The Rajya Sabha, also known as the Council of States, is one of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament
	- It was established as a bicameral legislature, alongside the Lok Sabha, by the Constitution of India.
- Composition and Election
	- The Constitution mandates that the Rajya Sabha shall consist of a maximum of 250 members
	- Of these, 238 members are elected from the states and those Union Territories that have a Legislative Assembly. 
		- The allocation of these elected seats is based on two principles: population and the need to ensure that the smallest states or Union Territories receive at least one seat each
		- Members from a particular state are elected by the members of that state's Legislative Assembly
	- 12 members are nominated by the President of India
	- Members serve for a period of six years, with one-third of its body undergoing election every two years. 
	- Unlike the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha cannot be dissolved
	- Residential Requirement
		- Until 2003, candidates for Rajya Sabha elections needed to be ordinarily resident in the state from which they were contesting. 
		- However, an amendment to Section 3 of the Representation of People's Act in 2003 removed this requirement
		- This change has been noted for diluting its federal character
- Role and Powers
	- Primary Function: 
		- The Rajya Sabha was envisioned as a platform for representing the interests of different states and articulating their concerns at the national level
	- Equality on Non-Fiscal Matters: 
		- On non-fiscal matters, the Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha. 
		- A non-Money Bill can be introduced in either House and must be passed in identical form to become law.
	- Exclusive Powers
		- It can declare, by a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, that it is necessary in the national interest for Parliament to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in the state list
		- It can pass a similar resolution for the creation of one or more all-India services (under Article 312)
		-  It can approve special emergency proclamations or extend them when the Lok Sabha is under dissolution (under Articles 352, 356, and 360)
- Evolution and Challenges
	- Federal Representation: 
		- Despite being designed as the "Council of States," the Rajya Sabha has been criticized for not truly representing state interests
		- The dilution of the residential requirement for members detracts from its role as a representative of states
	- Accommodation of Leaders: 
		- The membership profile shows that political parties often use Rajya Sabha seats to accommodate senior leaders who may have been defeated in Lok Sabha elections
	- Impact on Legislation: 
		- Since the late 1990s, the national ruling party or alliance has often lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, creating challenges in passing legislation. 
		- The Speaker's ability to certify certain bills as Money Bills can bypass the Rajya Sabha's scrutiny, effectively diluting its role as a federal and revising chamber
- Conclusion
	- In summary, the Rajya Sabha serves as a crucial institution for ensuring that the voices and interests of individual states are represented at the national level, contributing to the balance and functioning of Indian federalism
