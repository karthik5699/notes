# Pala phase of Buddhism

The _Pala dynasty_ (8thâ€“12th century CE), ruling over eastern India (especially Bengal and Bihar), marked a _revivalist phase_ in Indian Buddhism after centuries of decline. Under the Palas, _Mahayana_ and _Vajrayana Buddhism_ flourished, not only within India but also found renewed global influence.

1. Royal Patronage and Institutional Development:
	- The Palas, especially Dharampala and Devapala, were devout Buddhists and extended generous state patronage
	- Major monastic universities like Nalanda were expanded and Vikramashila was founded (Dharampala)
2. Flourishing of Buddhist Philosophy and Education
	- These universities attracted students from Tibet, China, and Southeast Asia
	- Vajrayana Buddhism matured during this period
	- Strong _Buddhist cultural diplomacy_ with Tibet, Sri Lanka, and Java
3. Artistic and Iconographic Achievements
	- _Pala art_, especially bronze and stone sculptures, represented refined iconography of Mahayana and Vajrayana deities
	- The style influenced Nepalese and Tibetan Buddhist art, leading to the Pala School of Art
4. Last Stronghold before Decline
	- The Palas preserved Buddhism until its _terminal decline in India_ post-12th century due to Islamic invasions and socio-religious shifts


The Pala period was the _final golden age of Buddhism in India_, witnessing institutional, philosophical, and artistic zeniths. Its enduring legacy lies in the transmission of Buddhism to _Tibet and Southeast Asia_, shaping global Buddhist traditions even after its decline in India.
