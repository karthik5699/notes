# Alternate sources of energy

- Introduction
	- With conventional fuels limited and non-renewable, the government aims to boost alternative hydrocarbon sources like coal-bed methane, gas hydrates, oil shales, and underground coal gasification
- Coal-bed Methane
	- Natural gas stored within coal seams, formed during the coalification process and absorbed into the solid matrix of coal.
	- Classified as an unconventional source of natural gas due to its unique occurrence.
- Gas Hydrates
	- Created when gas and water mix under high pressure and low temperature conditions, typically found in ocean depths
	- US Geological Survey states that India has the second largest gas hydrates in World
	- Gas hydrate zones in Krishnaâ€“Godavari, Kerala, Konkan, Mahanadi and Andaman offshore areas.
- Shale Oil/Shale Gas
	- ![[Pasted image 20250914122232.png]]
	- Extracted from organic-rich sedimentary rocks known as oil shales, trapped within the pores and fractures of source rocks, primarily shale.
	- Unconventional resources due to their unique occurrence and extraction methods.
	- Hydraulic fracturing is used for commercial production.
	- Shale gas formations in various sedimentary basins in India such as Gangetic plain, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, and coastal areas like Cambay.
