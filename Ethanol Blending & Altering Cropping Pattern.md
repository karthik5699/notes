# Ethanol Blending & Altering Cropping Pattern

India’s _ethanol blending programme (EBP)_, aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels and enhancing energy security, seeks to achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025-26. This has spurred a policy push toward ethanol production from sugarcane, maize, and surplus food grains, impacting cropping patterns across the country.

Alteration in Cropping Patterns due to EBP:
- Increased Sugarcane Cultivation
	- Sugarcane, being a major feedstock, is witnessing expansion in states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, even in water-stressed regions
- Diversion toward Maize and Food Grains
	- Government is encouraging ethanol from maize, leading to its increased cultivation in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Telangana
	- _National Bio-Energy Policy (2018)_ promotes use of surplus rice and damaged grains for ethanol.
- Monocropping and Commercial Orientation
	- Shift from diversified cropping to monocultures (sugarcane, maize), reducing traditional food and pulse cultivation.

Consequences for Small and Marginal Farmers:
- Positive Outcomes
	- Ethanol procurement by oil marketing companies offers a stable market
	- Sugarcane and maize, under government incentives, may yield better profits than traditional crops
- Challenges and Risks:
	- Sugarcane and maize are water- and input-intensive. Small farmers lack irrigation access, leading to unequal benefits
	- Shift from food to fuel crops may reduce local food availability and affect nutrition levels
	- Benefits accrue mainly to large landholders or sugar mills with distilleries; smallholders often left out


While India’s ethanol blending programme aligns with energy security and climate commitments, its uneven impact on cropping patterns necessitates safeguards. Policies must ensure _equitable benefit-sharing_, promote _sustainable cropping systems_, and provide _institutional support_ (credit, irrigation, MSP) to protect small and marginal farmers from unintended distress.



## Personal Analysis:
India has emerged as the world’s third-largest biofuel producer. The USA is the largest producer followed by Brazil.
