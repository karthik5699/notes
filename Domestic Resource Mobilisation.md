# Domestic Resource Mobilisation

- Introduction
	- Resource mobilisation refers to the process of acquiring and accumulating various types of resources—financial, human, and natural—to fund an economy's developmental objectives
- Types of Resources
	- Financial Resources: 
		- This includes capital from both domestic sources (public revenue, private savings, corporate investments) and external sources (FDI, FPI, external borrowings)
	- Human Resources: 
		- A skilled and productive population is a nation's most valuable asset.
	- Natural Resources: 
		- The sustainable use of land, water, and minerals is crucial for long-term development.
- Domestic Resource Mobilisation
	- Introduction
		- Rapidly evolving global landscape is making traditional globalized policies less effective as nations turn inward. 
		- This unfortunate reality highlights the urgent need for effective domestic resource mobilization.
		- As noted in the Economic Survey 2024-25 as external growth drivers become less reliable, a nation's ability to internally generate and deploy its financial, human, and natural resources is now critical for resilience and sustained development.
		- Domestic Resources are considered more stable and reliable, providing a strong foundation for long-term growth.
	- **Savings, Investment, and Capital Formation**
		- Savings and investment are the primary engines of economic growth. 
		- They fuel Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) that enhance an economy's productive capacity.
		- Savings: 
			- The portion of income not spent on consumption, typically accumulated in the form of bank deposits, investments, or assets.
		- Investment: 
			- The allocation of resources (typically capital) to generate future returns. 
			- It includes spending on machinery, infrastructure, and other assets to create long-term productive value.
		- Savings, when channelled effectively, become investments
		- Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF): 
			- A measure of investment, representing the creation of physical assets like machinery, buildings, and infrastructure. 
			- A higher GFCF enhances an economy's productive capacity.
		- Higher savings lead to higher investment (GFCF), which boosts production, creates jobs, and increases incomes. This, in turn, leads to higher savings, creating a self-sustaining cycle of growth.

	- Trends of India's Savings Rate
		- Household Savings: 
			- Traditionally the largest component, it includes financial and physical savings.
			- Household savings, traditionally the largest component of India’s gross domestic savings, have <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">declined to 18.1% of GDP in FY24</mark>, continuing a three-year downward trend
		- Corporate Savings: 
			- Retained profits of companies that are reinvested. 
			- Private corporate sector gross savings were estimated around <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">11% of GDP in FY24,</mark> a figure that has remained stable in recent years
		- Public Savings: 
			- The surplus (or deficit) of government revenue over consumption expenditure.
		- Gross Domestic Savings Rate: 
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">30.7% of GDP in FY24</mark>
			- This includes household, corporate, and government savings.
		- Household Financial Liabilities: 
			- 6.2% of GDP in FY24 Indicates a rise in household borrowing and reliance on credit.
		- Historically, India has maintained a respectable savings rate. However, a key policy challenge has been to efficiently translate these savings into productive investments.
	- The Investment Paradox: Sluggish Private Investment and GFCF
		- A defining feature of India's recent growth story is its heavy reliance on consumption. 
		- Private consumption accounts for 60% of GDP, while GFCF contributes only around 31%
		- This is in sharp contrast to investment-led models like China, where GFCF has consistently been above 40%. 
		- The government has sought to catalyse private investment through a significant increase in its own capital expenditure, hoping to "crowd in" private players by creating demand and improving infrastructure.
		- Reasons for sluggish private investment in India
			- Policy & Regulatory challenges
				- Complex regulations, land acquisition delays and lengthy dispute resolution deter private investment
			- High cost of borrowing
				- High bank NPAs limit credit availability increase borrowing cost for firms
			- Low consumer demand
				- Weak export demand competition from cheap imports further discourage capacity expansion
			- "Crowing Out" by Public investment
				- High government capex can absorb available capital, limiting private sector access to funds
