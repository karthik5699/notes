# Contributions of Pallavas to Indian Heritage & Culture

The Pallavas (2nd - 9th century CE) were an ancient South Indian dynasty active in the Andhra region from the second century CE onwards, who later moved south to settle in Tamil Nadu.

### Contributions to Art and Architecture
- The Pallavas patronised art and built temples in places like Panamalai, Mandagapattu, and Kanchipuram
- The Early buildings (rock-cut) are generally attributed to the reign of Mahendravarman I, a contemporary of the Chalukyan king Pulakeshin II
	- His inscription at Mandagapattu mentions him having titles like Vichitrachitta ("curious-minded"), Chitrakarapuli ("tiger among artists"), and Chaityakari ("temple builder"), indicating his interest in art activities
- Paintings at the Kanchipuram temple were patronised by the Pallava king Rajsimha, showing traces of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Somaskanda</mark>
- The famous Sittannavasal paintings belong to Pallavas
- Narasimhavarman I, also known as Mamalla, inaugurated most of the building works at Mahabalipuram (Mamallapuram), which is named after him
- Bronze images were modelled and cast during the Pallava Period
	- Although bronze images were modelled and cast during the Pallava Period in the eighth and ninth centuries, some of the most beautiful and exquisite statues were produced during the Chola Period in Tamil Nadu from the tenth to the twelfth century.
- Their temples contributed to the Dravida, or south Indian style of temple architecture


### Contributions to Literature and Writing
- The Tamil script first appeared in the Pallava territory in the 7th century CE and became widespread in the far south in the Chola period.
- Tamil became an important language of South Indian inscriptions under the Pallava dynasty
- The Devaram composed by Nayanars and the Nalayaradivyaprabandam composed by Alvars represent the rich religious literature of this period  
- Coins with lion and bull motifs, some inscribed with titles, have been associated with the Pallavas


In summary, the Pallavas, particularly kings like Mahendravarman I and Narasimhavarman I, played a crucial role in the development of the distinct Dravida style. They were also instrumental in the evolution of scripts used in South India, notably Grantha and the Tamil script, and the increased use of Tamil in inscriptions.
