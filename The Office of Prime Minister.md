# The Office of Prime Minister

- Introduction
	- The office of the Prime Minister is a cornerstone of India's parliamentary democracy, serving as the head of the Union government
	- While the President is the constitutional head of state, real executive power typically resides with the Council of Ministers, which is led by the Prime Minister
	- Article 74: Council of Ministers with PM at the head to aid and advise the President.
- Appointment
	- The President appoints the Prime Minister, who is typically the leader of the party or coalition commanding a majority in the Lok Sabha. 
	- Other ministers are then appointed by the President on the PM's recommendation. 
	- The PM serves during the pleasure of the President
- Foundation and Evolution
	- Jawaharlal Nehru (1947–1964)
		- On August 15, 1947, Nehru assumed office as the first Prime Minister of the country, with Sardar Patel as Deputy Prime Minister
		- He consolidated Union authority through nation-building efforts like the States Reorganisation Act (1956) and by chairing the Planning Commission (1950), which centralized economic planning. 
		- The one-party dominance of the Congress system during his era allowed the Prime Minister to mediate regional issues through intra-party structures
	- Indira Gandhi (1966–1977, 1980–1984): 
		- Her tenure marked the peak of centralization and an unprecedented assertion of Prime Ministerial authority. 
		- She frequently used the office of Governors and Article 356 (President's Rule) to dismiss state governments, subordinating federal autonomy to central political calculations. 
		- Power was centralized in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), reducing state leaders to dependents. 
		- She explicitly advanced the idea of a "committed bureaucracy" to align the civil service with the ruling regime's ideological objectives. 
		- The Emergency (1975–1977) epitomized this concentration of power, with the Prime Minister's role becoming hegemonic
	- Coalition Era (1989–2014): 
		- The decline of Congress dominance and the rise of regional parties led to a significant reshaping of the Prime Minister's role. 
		- Prime Ministers like V. P. Singh, H. D. Deve Gowda, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to negotiate with coalition partners, resulting in a more accommodative federal style focused on negotiation and consensus-building
	- Narendra Modi (2014–Present): 
		- The current era has seen a resurgence of centralized executive authority, combining elements of centralization with initiatives for cooperative and competitive federalism
		- Modi's leadership is characterized by single-party majority rule, assertive personalized leadership, and PMO-centric governance, often bypassing traditional cabinet processes
- Relationship with Other Institutions
	- The Cabinet: 
		- The Cabinet operates on the principle of collective responsibility, meaning that all members are publicly bound by collective decisions once made. 
		- The PM is traditionally considered primus inter pares ("first among equals")
	- Parliament: 
		- The PM's authority hinges on commanding a working majority in the Lok Sabha.
		- The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha
- Criticism
	- Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) increasingly influential, raising concerns of centralisation
		- Evolution of PMO
			- Nehru Era (1947–1964)
				- PMO not very powerful institutionally—policy routed through Cabinet Secretariat.
			- Shastri Era (1964–66)
				- PMO gained importance as Shastri lacked Nehru’s stature.
				- Needed stronger institutional support → PMO started emerging as policy coordination hub
			- Indira Gandhi Era (1966–77; 1980–84)
				- Turning point: rise of “Prime Ministerial Government.”
				- PMO grew into a powerful parallel body to Cabinet Secretariat.
				- Accused of weakening Cabinet system.
			- Coalition Era (1989–2014)
				- Decline in PM’s personal authority; PMO had to negotiate with allies.
				- P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991–96): used PMO strategically to push economic reforms.
				- Manmohan Singh (2004–14): PMO overshadowed by bodies like National Advisory Council and Group of Ministers
			- Current Era (2014–present)
				- PMO emerged as supreme policy nerve-centre
				- Centralisation of decision-making
				- Bureaucrats, technocrats, and PMO-driven governance.
	- Critics have argued that the Cabinet government has transformed into a prime ministerial government, wherein the Prime Minister wields "near-Presidential powers"
