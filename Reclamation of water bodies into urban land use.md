## Questions:

1. What are the environmental implications of the reclamation of water bodies into urban land use? explain with examples?

# Reclamation of water bodies into urban land use

- Introduction
	- A **water body**—lake, pond, wetland, river floodplain—serves as a natural regulator. 
	- It collects excess rainwater, allows groundwater recharge, provides habitat, and moderates microclimate.
	- When it is **reclaimed** (drained, filled, or concretised) for urban land use, you are essentially deleting a natural buffer system and replacing it with an impermeable surface
- Environmental Implications
	- **Loss of natural drainage:** 
		- Water bodies act like sponges. Reclaiming them removes storage space for monsoon or stormwater. Result: flooding.
	- **Decline in groundwater recharge:** 
		- Wetlands allow percolation. Filling them reduces aquifer replenishment, causing water scarcity.
	- Wetlands and lakes are habitats for fish, amphibians, birds, and micro-organisms. Reclaiming them means species displacement and extinction.
	- Water bodies cool surrounding areas via evaporation. Their loss raises local temperatures—an <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">urban heat island effect</mark>.
	- Lakes act as sediment traps and natural filters. Their removal means pollutants flow directly into rivers or groundwater.
	- Many communities depend on wetlands for fishing, farming (wetland paddy), or informal livelihoods. Reclamation displaces them.
- Conclusion
	- Reclaiming a water body for urban use looks like “development” on paper—more land, more real estate—but functionally it’s ecological debt. 
	- The city loses its natural insurance against floods, droughts, heat, and pollution
