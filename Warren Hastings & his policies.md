Warren Hastings served as the first Governor-General of India from 1773 to 1785. His tenure was crucial for the expansion and consolidation of British power in India. His policies established significant administrative and judicial frameworks, initiated a more aggressive foreign policy, and set precedents for future British rule.

- Under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established in Bengal with original and appellate jurisdictions, where all subjects could seek redressal
- Abolition of Dual System (1772)
	- Hastings did away with the Dual System in Bengal, which had been established by Robert Clive
- Policy of Ring-Fence: 
	- Hastings followed a policy of "ring-fence," which aimed at creating buffer zones to defend the Company’s frontiers. 
	- This involved defending the frontiers of their neighbours to safeguard the Company's own territories, particularly Bengal.
	- The chief danger to the Company’s territories was from the Afghan invaders and the Marathas. 
	- To safeguard against these dangers, the Company undertook to organise the defence of the frontiers of Awadh on the condition that the Nawab would defray the expenses of the defending army.
- Significant Conflicts and Challenges during his Rule
	- Rohilla War (1774)
	- First Maratha War (1775-1782): 
		- The war concluded with the Treaty of Salbai in 1782, which guaranteed peace for twenty years
	- Second Mysore War (1780-1784)
		- The war concluded with Treaty of Mangalore
	- Sanyasi Revolt (1763-1800)
		- They raided Company factories and the treasuries, and fought the Company’s forces. 
		- It was only after a prolonged action that Warren Hastings could subdue the sanyasis
- Warren Hastings, in order to meet the war expenses against the Marathas and Mysore, made a plan to earn money by involving English officers as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">izaradars</mark> (revenue farmers) in Awadh
- Hastings believed that the ancient customs of the country and Oriental learning should form the basis of British rule in India. He took the initiative to establish the Calcutta Madrasah in 1781
- Upon his return to England in 1785, Warren Hastings was accused by Edmund Burke of misgovernment of Bengal.
	- Burke famously stated, "*I impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert*"


Warren Hastings laid the foundation of British rule in India by building a strong central administration and legal system. Though his policies aimed at better control and revenue collection, they also marked the beginning of colonial exploitation.
