# Plateaus 

![[Pasted image 20250722162934.png]]
- Introduction
	- A plateau is a flat-topped table land.
	- Plateaus occur in every continent and take up a third of the Earths land.
	- Plateaus, like mountains may be young or old. The Deccan plateau in India is one of the oldest plateaus
	- Valleys form when river water cuts through the plateau.
	- Sometimes, a plateau is so eroded that it is broken up into smaller raised sections called outliers
	- Plateaus are very useful because they are rich in mineral deposits. As a result, many of the mining areas in the world are located in the plateau areas.
- Significance
	- Iron, copper, gold, diamonds, Manganese, coal, etc., are found in these plateaus.
	- East African plateau is famous for gold and diamond mining
	- In India huge reserves of iron, coal and manganese are found in the Chhotanagpur plateau.
	- In the plateau areas, there may be several waterfalls as the river falls from a great height. 
		- In India, the Hundru Falls in the Chhotanagpur plateau on the river Subarnarekha and the Jog Falls in Karnataka are examples of such waterfalls. 
		- These sites are ideal for hydro-electric power generation. 
		- Angel falls in Venezuela is also a waterfall that descends down a plateau
	- The lava plateaus like Deccan traps are rich in black soil that is fertile and good for cultivation. 
		- Example: Maharashtra has good cotton growing soils called regurs.
	- Loess plateau in China has very fertile soils that are good for many kind of crops

	- Many plateaus have scenic spots and are of great attraction to tourists. (Grand Canyon, USA, many waterfalls)
- Plateau Formation
	- Tectonic plateaus are formed from processes that create mountain ranges – <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">volcanism</mark> (Deccan Plateau), <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">crustal shortening</mark> (thrusting of one block of crust over another, and folding occurs. Example: Tibet), and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">thermal expansion</mark> (Ethiopian Highlands)
	- Thermal expansion
		- When the lithosphere underlying a broad area is heated rapidly – e.g., by an upwelling of hot material in the underlying asthenosphere – the consequent warming and thermal expansion of the uppermost mantle causes an uplift of the overlying surface
		- Those caused by thermal expansion of the lithosphere are usually associated with hot spots. 
		- The Yellowstone Plateau in the United States, the Massif Central in France, and the Ethiopian Plateau in Africa are prominent examples.
	- Crustal Shortening
		- Crustal shortening is the compression of Earth's crust, causing it to buckle, fold, or thrust, forming mountain ranges or plateaus.
		- The great heights of some plateaus, such as the Plateau of Tibet is due to crustal shortening.

	- Volcanic Flood Basalts – Traps
		- A third type of plateau can form where extensive lava flows (called flood basalts or traps) and volcanic ash bury preexisting terrain, as exemplified by the Columbia Plateau in the northwestern United States, Deccan Traps of peninsular India, Laurentian plateau or The Canadian Shield and the Siberian Traps of Russia.
- Plateau Types
	- There are two kinds of plateaus: dissected plateaus and volcanic plateaus.
	- Dissected plateau
		- A dissected plateau forms as a result of upward movement in the Earth’s crust.
		- The uplift is caused by the slow collision of tectonic plates. The Colorado Plateau, in the western United States, Tibetan plateau etc. are examples
	- Volcanic plateau
		- A volcanic plateau is formed by numerous small volcanic eruptions that slowly build up over time, forming a plateau from the resulting lava flows
		- The **Columbia Plateau** in the northwestern United States of America and **Deccan Traps** are two such plateaus.
	- Others
		- **Intermontane plateaus** are the highest in the world, bordered by mountains. The **Tibetan Plateau** is one such plateau.

- Major plateaus of the World
	- ![[Pasted image 20250722165717.png]]
	- Tibetan Plateau
		- Highest and largest plateau in the world and hence called the ‘roof of the world’.
		- Formed due to collision of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian tectonic plates
		- The plateau is sufficiently high enough to reverse the Hadley cell convection cycles and to drive the monsoons of India towards the south
	- Deccan Plateau
		- The plateau includes the Deccan Traps which is the largest volcanic feature on Earth
		- Made of multiple basalt layers or lava flows
		- The Deccan Traps are known for containing some unique fossils
		- The Deccan is rich in minerals. 
		- Primary mineral ores found in this region are mica and iron ore in the Chhotanagpur region, and diamonds, gold and other metals in the Golconda region
	- Kimberley Plateau
		- Lies in the northern part of Australia.
		- Many minerals like iron, gold, lead, zinc, silver and diamond are found here
		- Diamond is also found here.
