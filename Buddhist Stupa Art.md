# Buddhist Stupa Art

Stupas can be understood as the burial mounds hemispheric structure where the dead's relics and ashes were kept. They were also significant as pilgrimage sites. Since Vedic times, the stupas were common throughout India, but they attained the status of cult worship during King Ashoka's reign who divided the Buddha's relics and enshrined them in numerous stupas across his empire.

Early Buddhist Stupa art (3rd century BCE â€“ 2nd century CE), seen at places like Sanchi, Bharhut, and Amaravati, served two purposes: it kept local artistic traditions alive and also expressed key Buddhist ideas and values. Instead of showing the Buddha in human form, the art used symbols and popular stories to share his teachings with ordinary people.

Sanchi Stupa
- constructed by Ashoka in Madhya Pradesh
- the discovery of Sanchi has vastly transformed our understanding of early buddhism
- gateways are carved with images from the life of Buddha, his past lives (Jataka tales) and symbols representing buddhist teachings
- a UNESCO world heritage site

Buddhist Stupa-art expounds Buddhist ideas:
- Stupa-art often uses symbolic representations to convey Buddhist concepts. These symbols include the wheel of Dharma, lotus flowers, Bodhi trees, and various celestial beings. 
	- for instance the Bodhi tree simply does not stand for a tree, but symbolises an event in Buddha's life when he achieved enlightenment
- Stupas often feature narratives from the Jataka tales. These tales depict moral lessons and ethical values, such as compassion, generosity, and selflessness.
- portrays scenes that illustrate the Buddha's teachings and important events from his life. These depictions serve as visual aids for understanding and assimilating Buddhist philosophy.
- Early Buddhist stupa-art often incorporates local folk motifs and artistic styles from the surrounding regions. By doing so, it successfully integrates local cultural elements and resonates with the common people. 
	- Some sculptures in Sanchi stupa include Shalabhanjikas. The shalabhanjika motif suggests that many people who turned to Buddhism enriched it with their own pre-Buddhist and even non-Buddhist beliefs, practices and ideas.
