# Government of India Act, 1935

The Constituent Assembly completed its historic task of drafting the Constitution for Independent India in just three years, partly due to the experience gained with the Government of India Act, 1935


Influence of the Government of India Act, 1935:
- A Pre-existing Framework and Learning Experience
	- The Government of India Act of 1935, passed by the British Parliament, provided a comprehensive constitutional blueprint for India
	- Although largely condemned by the Congress, its provisions, which included an All-India Federation and provincial autonomy, and the division of subjects into federal, provincial, and concurrent lists, offered a starting point.
	- This meant the Constituent Assembly didn't have to start from scratch on many structural issues. 
	- The Act's operative part remained in force until August 15, 1947
- Practical Governance Experience
	- The 1935 Act prescribed provincial autonomy and led to elections in 1937, where the Congress formed ministries in 7 out of 11 provinces
	- This period of "Twenty-Eight Months of Congress Rule" provided Indian leaders with invaluable administrative and legislative experience
	- They learned how to use state power to further nationalist aims, manage finances (even with constraints), and engage with bureaucratic structures
	- This hands-on experience, even within a limited framework, helped build confidence in Indian self-governance
- Identification of Flaws to Avoid
	- The Congress ministries' experience also highlighted the significant drawbacks of the 1935 Act.
	- They recognized the limitations of provincial powers, inadequate financial resources, and the overriding authority of the governor-general and governors
	- The Act's extension of communal electorates and promotion of various interests were seen as fostering separatist tendencies that culminated in the partition of India
	- The failure of the dyarchy system at the provincial level also served as a lesson
	- This understanding of what not to incorporate, or how to improve upon existing structures, proved crucial for the framers

Distinct Approach of the Constituent Assembly:

Despite the practical lessons from the 1935 Act, the Constituent Assembly's task was fundamentally different, reflecting the aspirations of a newly independent nation
- Sovereignty and Indian Will: 
	- Unlike the 1935 Act which was enacted by the colonial government and was not directly debated or formulated by Indians, the Constituent Assembly was a sovereign body responsible for framing a constitution based on the will of the Indian people
- Universal Adult Franchise: 
	- A revolutionary step taken by the Constituent Assembly was the adoption of universal adult franchise, allowing all Indians above 21 (regardless of gender, class, or education) to vote
	- This was a stark contrast to the very limited electorate (10-15% of the adult population) under the 1935 Act

In conclusion, while the structural framework and the practical governance experience provided by the Government of India Act, 1935, undoubtedly offered a valuable foundation and accelerated the drafting process, the Constituent Assembly actively chose to reject and fundamentally transform many aspects of the Act to create a truly sovereign, democratic, and socially just Constitution rooted in the aspirations of the Indian people.
