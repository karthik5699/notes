# Vertical & Horizontal Temperature Distribution of Oceans

- Temperature Distribution of Oceans
	- Source of Heat in Oceans
		- The sun is the principal source of energy (Insolation).
		- The ocean is also heated by the inner heat of the ocean itself (earth’s interior is hot. At the sea surface, the crust is only about 5 to 30 km thick)
	- How does deep water marine organisms survive in spite of absence of sunlight?
		- ![[Pasted image 20250719173254.png]]
		- Photic zone is only about few hundred meters. It depends on lot of factors like turbidity, presence of algae etc.
		- There are not enough primary producers below few hundred meters till the ocean bottom
		- At the sea bottom, there are bacteria that make use of heat supplied by earth’s interior to prepare food. So, they are the primary producers
		- So, the heat from earth supports wide ranging deep water marine organisms
		- But the productivity is low compared to ocean surface.
- Why is diurnal range of ocean temperatures too small?, Why oceans take more time to heat or cool?
	- The process of heating and cooling of the oceanic water is slower than land due to vertical and horizontal mixing and high specific heat of water.
- Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution of Oceans
	- Insolation: 
		- The average daily duration of insolation and its intensity.
	- Heat loss: 
		- The loss of energy by reflection, scattering, evaporation and radiation.
	- Albedo: 
		- The albedo of the sea
	- The physical characteristics of the sea surface: 
		- Boiling point of the sea water is increased in the case of higher salinity and vice versa (Salinity increased == Boiling point increased == Evaporation decreased)
	- The presence of submarine ridges and sills ([[Marginal Seas]]): 
		- Temperature is affected due to lesser mixing of waters on the opposite sides of the ridges or sills
	- The shape of the ocean: 
		- The latitudinally extensive seas in low latitude regions have warmer surface water than longitudinally extensive sea 
		- Mediterranean Sea records higher temperature than the longitudinally extensive Gulf of California
	- Local weather conditions such as cyclones
	- Unequal distribution of land and water: 
		- The oceans in the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact with larger extent of land than the oceans in the southern hemisphere.
	- Prevalent winds generate horizontal and sometimes vertical ocean currents: 
		- The winds blowing from the land towards the oceans (off-shore winds-moving away from the shore) drive warm surface water away from the coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below
		- Contrary to this, the onshore winds (winds flowing from oceans into continents) pile up warm water near the coast and this raises the temperature
	- Ocean currents: 
		- Warm ocean currents raise the temperature in cold areas while the cold currents decrease the temperature in warm ocean areas

- # Vertical Temperature Distribution of Oceans
	- Photic or euphotic zone extends from the upper surface to ~200 m. 
	- The photic zone receives adequate solar insolation.
	- Aphotic zone extends from 200 m to the ocean bottom; this zone does not receive adequate sun rays
	- Thermocline
		- ![[Pasted image 20250719175011.png]]
		- The profile shows a boundary region between the surface waters of the ocean and the deeper layers
		- The boundary usually begins around 100 – 400 m below the sea surface and extends several hundred of meters downward.
		- This boundary region, from where there is a rapid decrease of temperature, is called the **thermocline**. 
		- About 90 per cent of the total volume of water is found below the thermocline in the deep ocean.
	- Three-Layer System
		- The temperature structure of oceans over middle and low latitudes can be described as a three-layer system from surface to the bottom.
		- The first layer represents the top layer of warm oceanic water and it is about 500m thick with temperatures ranging between 20° and 25° C. 
			- This layer, within the tropical region, is present throughout the year but in mid-latitudes it develops only during summer
		- The second layer called the thermocline layer lies below the first layer and is characterized by rapid decrease in temperature with increasing depth. 
			- The thermocline is 500 -1000m thick.
		- The third layer is very cold and extends up to the deep ocean floor. Here the temperature becomes almost stagnant
	- General behavior
		- In the Arctic and Antarctic circles, the surface water temperatures are close to 0° C and so the temperature change with the depth is very slight (ice is a very bad conductor of heat). 
		- Here, only one layer of cold water exists, which extends from surface to deep ocean floor.
		- The rate of decrease of temperature with depths is greater at the equator than at the poles.
		- In equatorial regions the surface water sometimes exhibits **lower temperature and salinity** due to high rainfall, whereas the layers below it have higher temperatures.
			- The enclosed seas of low latitudes like the Sargasso Sea, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea have high bottom temperatures due to high insolation throughout the year and lesser mixing of the warm and cold waters
- # **Horizontal Temperature Distribution of Oceans**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250719180505.png]]
	- The average temperature of surface water of the oceans is about 27°C and it gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles.
	- The horizontal temperature distribution is shown by isothermal lines, i.e., lines joining places of equal temperature.
	- The oceans and seas get heated and cooled slower than the land surfaces. 
	- Therefore, even if the solar insolation is maximum at noon, the ocean surface temperature is highest at 2 p.m.
	- The average diurnal or daily range of temperature is barely 1 degree in oceans and seas.
	- The maximum and the minimum temperatures in oceans are slightly delayed than those of land areas (the maximum being in August and the minimum in February)
