1. Account for the legal and political factors responsible for the reduced frequency of using Article 356 by the Union Government since mid-1990s

# Article 356

- Introduction
	- Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, providing for President's Rule, was used over 100 times before the mid-1990s, often for partisan reasons. 
	- Its subsequent decline is a result of a powerful combination of judicial checks and fundamental shifts in India's political landscape.
- Legal Factors:
	- The primary legal deterrent emerged from the Supreme Court's landmark judgment in **S.R. Bommai vs. Union of India (1994)**. 
	- This verdict established that:
		- The proclamation under Article 356 is subject to **judicial review**.
		- The burden of proof lies on the Centre to show that relevant material existed to justify the imposition of President's Rule.
		- It affirmed that federalism and secularism are part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution.
	- This judgment effectively ended the era of arbitrary dismissals of state governments by making the Centre's actions justiciable.
- Political Factors:
	- End of Single-Party Dominance: 
		- The advent of the coalition era at the Centre from 1989 onwards was the most significant political factor. 
		- Central governments, dependent on regional parties for their own survival, could no longer use Article 356 against them without risking their own stability.
	- Rise of Strong Regional Parties: 
		- The increasing political and electoral might of regional parties created a more balanced federal dynamic, shifting power away from a dominant Centre.
	- Advisory Role of Commissions: 
		- The recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission (1988) and later the Punchhi Commission (2007), which advocated for its use only in the "rarest of rare cases" and as a "last resort," created sustained intellectual and moral pressure against its misuse.
- Conclusion
	- The legal and political factors worked together to limit the use of Article 356 -- the _S.R. Bommai_ case provided the legal 'stick', while coalition politics provided the political 'check'.
