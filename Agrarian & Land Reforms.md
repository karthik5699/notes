# Agrarian & Land Reforms

India, in its post-independence phase, recognized economic development and social justice, particularly in the agrarian sector, as crucial challenges.

- At the time of independence, the agricultural sector was characterized by:
	- Highly concentrated land ownership
	- Landlords extracted maximum rental from tenants, leaving them with no money for agricultural development
	- Unorganized land and numerous small, fragmented holdings
	- Cultivators were frequently shifted by landlords at will
	- Many cultivators had to supplement their income by working as hired labourers
- Objectives of Land Reforms
	- Abolition of Intermediaries (Zamindari System)
	- Land Ceilings
	- Consolidation of Holdings:
		- To bring small, fragmented land pieces together for more efficient agricultural management
	- Encouragement of Co-operative joint farming
		- Aimed to pool small landholdings for collective cultivation, improving efficiency and reducing fragmentation
	- Settlement and Regulation of Tenancy
		- To facilitate regulation of rent, security of tenure and ownership rights 
- Implementation and Challenges of Land Reforms
	- Many argued that ceiling and tenancy legislation would infringe upon the **right to property** under Article 19
	- As land reforms were a state subject, the Planning Commission struggled to convince states, leading to the dilution of the reform strategy
	- Implementing reforms slowly allowed landlords to transfer land to relatives and friends, evading land ceiling laws on paper
	- Land ceilings often did not yield enough land to meet the needs of the vast tenant population. A large portion of recovered land remained undistributed and uncultivated.
	- The landowning classes, who benefited from rising agricultural productivity and land values, held significant social and political power and bitterly opposed ceilings on holdings, preventing serious efforts to organize the landless
	- Significant progress in consolidating holdings was limited to Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab. Elsewhere, momentum was lost. 
		- Farmers' emotional attachment to ancestral land, fear of receiving inferior land, and slow, corrupt officials also hindered the process
- Cooperative Farming
	- The Second Five Year Plan lay the foundation for the development of Cooperative farming, with the aim of bringing substantial proportion of agricultural land under cooperative farming over a period of 10 years
	- The 1959 Nagpur Resolution by the Congress even visualized joint cooperative farming as the future agrarian pattern to be achieved within three years
	- However, this faced strong opposition from leaders like C. Rajagopalachari, N.G. Ranga, and Charan Singh
	- Cooperative farming, which was sought to be promoted by citing China's success in the cooperative agriculture, lost its appeal after the Chinese aggressions in Tibet & later India. 
- Limitations of Cooperativization:
	- Rich and landowning farmers formed such cooperatives to evade land reforms and access incentives offered by the state
	- Credit cooperatives largely excluded the landless from securing credit and suffered from high loan defaults, with rich and landowning communities being the largest defaulters
	- Overall, the cooperative movement became overstaffed and inefficient due to excessive government involvement
- Success of Cooperatives: <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The White Revolution</mark>
	- The most significant success in cooperatives came from the milk sector, leading to the 'White Revolution'
	- This experiment that started in Kaira (also called Kheda) District of Gujarat eventually led to the ‘White Revolution’ that spread all over India.
	- Peasants, feeling exploited by milk traders, formed a cooperative union at the initiative of Sardar Patel and Morarji Desai
	- Tribhuvandas K. Patel persuaded farmers to form cooperatives, and Dr. Verghese Kurien served as CEO of the Kaira cooperative union (Amul)
	- Amul competed with multinational dairy companies and the "Anand Pattern" spread across Gujarat
	- Operation Flood (1970): 
		- Launched by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), headed by Verghese Kurien, this program replicated the "Anand Pattern" nationwide. 
		- It aimed to increase milk production, eliminate middlemen, and ensure regular income for producers
	- It was estimated that 60% of the beneficiaries were marginal or small farmers and landless labourers. Thus, Milk cooperatives proved to be a significant anti-poverty measure.
- Agrarian Policy Shift: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green Revolution</mark>
	- Despite early agricultural growth, India faced food shortages from the mid-1950s due to population growth, steady rise in per capita income, huge outlays towards planned industrialisation put long term pressures on Indian agriculture
	- Wars with China (1962) and Pakistan (1965), and successive droughts (1965-66) led to a severe food crisis and dependence on foreign aid (like PL-480 from the US)
	- Green Revolution involved offering 
		- high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds, 
		- fertilizers, pesticides, 
		- better irrigation at subsidized prices,
		- government-guaranteed procurement prices
		- and modern farming techniques to boost food grain production.
	- **M.S. Swaminathan** – Father of India’s Green Revolution
	- Phases:
		- First Phase (1962-65 to 1970-73): 
			- Sharp increases in wheat yield in Punjab, Haryana, and Western Uttar Pradesh
		- Second Phase (1970-73 to 1980-83): 
			- HYV technology extended from wheat to rice, spreading to Uttar Pradesh, coastal Andhra Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Gujarat
		- Third Phase (1980-83 to 1992-95): 
			- Spread to low-growth areas like Orissa, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, significantly reducing regional inequality
	- Positive Impacts:
		- Significantly increased food grain production, leading to self-sufficiency by the 1980s, with buffer stocks and even exports
		- Reduced dependence on foreign food imports
		- Generated employment in agriculture and non-agricultural rural sectors (agro-industries, transport)
		- Increased farmer income stimulated demand for consumer durables
		- Surplus food stocks enabled poverty alleviation programs
	- Negative Impacts
		- Huge disparity and polarization between classes and regions resulted in favourable conditions for left wing organisations to organise the poor peasants to follow extreme paths
		- Negative environmental impacts due to excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and unsustainable groundwater withdrawal
		- Subsidized or free electricity for farmers in the Green Revolution belt led to misuse and adversely affected the economy
