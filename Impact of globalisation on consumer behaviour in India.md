# Impact of globalisation on consumer behaviour in India

- Introduction
	- Globalization is a process that involves the increasing integration of the world's economies, cultures, politics, and environments. 
	- It is characterized by the movement of goods, services, capital, people, ideas, knowledge, and technology across borders.
- Globalization has facilitated the influx of global brands and multinational corporations into the Indian market, significantly altering consumer behavior 
	- Shift from scarcity mindset to choice abundance
		- Before 1991 reforms, the market was supply-constrained. 
		- Today, a middle-class buyer might have to choose between 15 shampoo brands and 50 smartphone models. 
		- Decision-making now involves _comparison_ rather than _just availability_.
	- Rise of brand consciousness
		- Global brands like Nike, Apple, Zara became aspirational. 
		- Brand names are now a shorthand for quality, style, and sometimes status.
	- Westernisation & hybrid tastes
		- Pizza Hut sells “paneer makhani” pizza; Starbucks offers “filter coffee” in Bengaluru. 
		- People are adopting global products but with local customisation
	- Digital-first shopping habits
		- E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and niche brands changed the purchase process—people compare reviews, watch influencer videos, and buy without ever touching the product.
	- Fast fashion & disposable culture
		- The Zara-H&M model of rapidly changing styles encourages buying more, using less time, and discarding faster—very different from the “buy once, use for years” mindset.
	- Greater consumer activism
		- Social media enables boycotts, petitions, and rapid spread of reviews. 
		- Consumers are more aware of ethical sourcing, sustainability, and labour conditions
- While the influx of global brands has reshaped India's consumer landscape, it has negatively impacted in many ways small-scale retailers, local vendors
