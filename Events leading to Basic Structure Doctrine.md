# Events leading to Basic Structure Doctrine

- **Champakam Dorairajan Case (1951)**
    - **Ruling:** Fundamental Rights (FRs) prevail over Directive Principles (DPSP).
- **1st Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA), 1951**
    - **Parliament's Action:** Added Articles 15(4), 31A, 31B, and the 9th Schedule to protect land reform laws from judicial review. 
- **Shankari Prasad Case (1951)**
    - **Ruling:** Upheld the 1st CAA. Declared that a Constitutional Amendment is **not 'law'** under Article 13. Parliament can amend FRs.    
- **Sajjan Singh Case (1965)**
    - **Ruling:** Maintained the position of the _Shankari Prasad_ case.
- **Golaknath Case (1967)**
    - **Ruling:** Overruled _Shankari Prasad_. An amendment **is 'law'** under Article 13. Parliament **cannot** abridge Fundamental Rights.   
- **Parliament's Reaction (1971-72)**
    - **24th CAA:** Nullified _Golaknath_. Article 13 shall not apply on CAAs. Gave Parliament explicit power to amend any part of the Constitution, including FRs.
    - **25th CAA:** Article 31C was added giving primacy to certain DPSPs (Art 39b, 39c) over FRs (Art 14, 19, 31).
    - **26th CAA:** Abolished Privy Purses, overturning an earlier SC judgment.  
- **Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973)**
    - **Ruling:** Overruled _Golaknath_ but introduced a new check.
    - **Final Doctrine:** Parliament **can amend any part** of the Constitution, including FRs, but **cannot alter its 'Basic Structure'**.
