## Questions:

1. Why are the world‚Äôs fold mountain systems located along the margins of continents? Bring out the association between the global distribution of Fold Mountains and the earthquakes and volcanoes.
2. Discuss the geophysical characteristics of Circum-Pacific Zone

# Earthquakes

- How are earthquake waves produced?
	- The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">abrupt release of energy along a fault (sharp break in the crustal layer) causes earthquake waves</mark>.
	- Rocks along a fault plane tend to move in opposite directions, but friction locks them together. 
	- When the tendency to move overcomes this friction, the blocks abruptly slide past one another, leading to a sudden release of energy
	- The point where the energy is released is called the focus or the hypocentre of an earthquake.
	- The point on the surface directly above the focus is called **epicentre**.
	- An instrument called ‚Äòseismograph‚Äô records the waves reaching the surface.
- Types of Seismic waves or earthquake waves
	- The earthquake waves are basically of two types ‚Äî body waves and surface waves.

	- Body waves
		- Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions travelling through the interior of the earth.
		- There are two types of body waves:
			- Primary Waves (P-waves)
				- P-waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface.
				- P-waves are longitudinal in nature ‚Äï wave propagation is similar to sound waves
					- particles of the medium move back and forth in the **same direction** as the wave is traveling
				- P-waves creates density differences in the material leading to stretching and squeezing of the material.
				- They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials
				- These waves are of relatively high frequency and are the least destructive among the earthquake waves.
			- Secondary Waves (S-Waves)
				- S-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag
				- They are transverse in nature ‚Äï wave propagation is similar to ripples on the surface of the water
				- Hence, they create **troughs** and **crests** in the material through which they pass
				- An important fact about S-waves is that they can travel only through solid materials. It has helped scientists to understand the structure of the interior of the earth.
				- These waves are of high frequency and possess slightly higher destructive power compared to P-waves.
			- Shadow zone of P-waves and S-Waves

				- ![[Pasted image 20250625162946.png]]
				- S-waves do not travel through liquids
				- This observation led to the discovery of the liquid outer core.
				- The shadow zone of P-waves appears as a band around the earth between 105¬∞ and 145¬∞ away from the epicentre
				- This is because P-waves are refracted when they pass through the transition between the semisolid mantle and the liquid outer core
				- However, the seismographs located beyond 145¬∞ from the epicentre, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves. This gives clues about the solid inner core.
	- Surface Waves
		- The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves (long or L-waves). These waves move only along the surface.
		- Surface Waves are also called long period waves because of their long wavelength.
		- They are low‚Äìfrequency transverse waves (shear waves)
		- They develop in the immediate neighbourhood of the epicentre and affect only the surface of the earth
		- They are slowest among the earthquake waves and are recorded last on the seismograph
		- Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.
- Effects of Earthquakes
	- Ground shaking
	- Differentiated ground settlement
	- Land & mud slides
	- Soil liquefaction
		- Solid ground temporarily behaves like a liquid, causing buildings to tilt or sink
	- Ground lurching
	- Avalanches
	- Ground Displacement
	- Floods from dam and levee failure
	- Fires
	- Tsunami
- Wadati-Benioff Zone
	- Is a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">zone of subduction along which earthquakes are common</mark>. 
	- The most powerful earthquakes occur along this zone
	- ![[Pasted image 20250701133126.png]]
	- Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zones can be produced by slip along the subduction thrust fault (Himalayan Region ‚Äì C-C convergent boundary) or slip on faults within the down-going plate (O-O and C-O convergent boundary)
- Distribution of Earthquakes
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Earth‚Äôs major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates.</mark>
	- The most important earthquake belt is the **Circum-Pacific Belt**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250701133357.png]]
	- Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the ‚Äú<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Pacific Ring of Fire</mark>.‚Äù
		- The Pacific Ring of Fire hosts several fold mountains (e.g., <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Rockies, Andes, Japanese Alps</mark>), aligning with high volcanic and seismicity zones
	- The Pacific Ring of Fire accounts for about 70 per cent of all earthquakes
	- Another 20% of earthquakes take place in the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Mediterranean-Himalayan belt</mark> including Asia Minor, the Himalayas and parts of north-west China
	- ![[Pasted image 20250701133912.png]]
	- Nearly 59% of India‚Äôs land area is prone to moderate or severe earthquakes
