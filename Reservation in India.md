# Reservation in India

- Introduction
	- Reservations in India, alternatively referred to as affirmative action, positive discrimination, or compensatory discrimination, represent a policy designed to grant justice to individuals from historically disadvantaged groups
- Historical Context
	- **Early Steps (Pre-Independence):**
		- Maharaja of Kolhapur (1902): 
			- Shahu IV took the first organized step, aiming to eradicate poverty among backward classes and increase their involvement in public administration
		- **Indian Councils Act of 1909 (Morleyâ€“Minto reforms):** 
			- Provided separate electorates for Muslims and reserved seats in various legislative bodies
		- **Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935:** 
			- Also included provisions for reservations, laying the foundation for India's intricate reservation framework
		- Constituent Assembly Debates
			- The Cabinet Mission Plan guaranteed seats for Muslims and Sikhs
			- The Congress leadership ensured representation for Parsis, Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and women under the 'General' category in the Assembly
			- During the framing of the Constitution, the need for quotas for the lowest castes and tribes was articulated by **Dalit leader Ambedkar** on grounds of poverty and exclusion, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">which would otherwise prevent them from exercising individual rights</mark>
		- Constitutional Provisions for Reservations
			- **Article 14:** 
				- Guarantees the right to equality before the law for all people
			- Article 15(4): 
				- Inserted by the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">First Amendment in 1951</mark>, this allows the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs)
			- Article 16(4): 
				- Permits the state to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of backward classes that are not adequately represented in state services
			- Article 46: 
				- A Directive Principle of State Policy, it mandates the state to promote the educational and economic interests of SCs and STs.
- Post-Constitutional Developments and Key Judgments
	- State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951): 
		- This was the first major confrontation between Parliament and the courts on reservations. 
		- The Supreme Court struck down detailed quota-based reservations in Madras colleges, finding them opposed to Article 29(2) (prohibiting discrimination in educational institutions based on religion, race, caste, or language). 
		- **Ruling:** Fundamental Rights (FRs) prevail over Directive Principles (DPSP).
		- In response, Parliament passed the First Amendment (1951), adding Article 15(4)
	- Kalelkar Commission (1953): 
		- Formed under Article 340, it identified 2399 backward groups primarily based on the traditional Hindu caste system
		- Its recommendations were not implemented
	- M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore (1962): 
		- The Supreme Court, in this case, set a general ceiling that reservations should not usually exceed 50 percent to balance merit with uplifting deprived classes
	- Mandal Commission (1979-1980): 
		- This commission was established to define and recommend steps for the advancement of "socially and educationally backward classes" (SEBCs).
		- It identified socially and economically backward castes, comprising about 52% of India's population. 
		- To comply with the 50% ceiling (given existing 22.5% for SC/ST), it recommended a 27% reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in central government services, public sector undertakings, etc. 
		- This marked the first time OBCs would have reservations in central government establishments
	-  Implementation and Political Impact of Mandal
		- Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government decided to implement the Mandal Commission's recommendations in 1990. 
		- This led to widespread social unrest and was seen as a key moment in "vote-bank politics" and the rise of Hindu nationalism
	- Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992): 
		- This landmark case challenged the constitutionality of the Mandal recommendations. 
		- A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the 27% reservation for OBCs
		- **"Creamy Layer" Exclusion:** 
			- The court famously ruled that **prosperous members ("creamy layer") of the backward classes should be excluded** from the reservation regime. 
		- 50% Ceiling Reaffirmed: 
			- The court reiterated the 50% reservation ceiling from the Balaji case
		- Economic Reservation Struck Down: 
			- A proposed 10% quota for economically backward persons was declared unconstitutional
		- Reservations in Promotions: 
			- The judgment also held that reservation in promotion was constitutionally impermissible, arguing that once equals are brought into the same class, further benefits based on prior inequality treat equals unequally
- Subsequent Developments and Ongoing Debates
	- Article 16(4A) (1995): 
		- Within three years of Indra Sawhney, Parliament inserted this article, permitting reservations for SCs and STs in promotions, specifically to nullify the court's stance against promotion quotas
	- M. Nagaraj vs Union of India (2006): 
		- This case dealt with challenges to the constitutional amendments allowing reservations in promotions. 
		- The Supreme Court upheld the essence of Indra Sawhney but provided flexibility for states to make promotion reservations for SC/STs if they collect quantifiable data demonstrating the backwardness and inadequate representation of the class
	- State of Punjab v/s Davinder SIngh (2024)
		- In this case Supreme Court allowed sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes.
		- The court overturned the judgement in EV Chinnaiah case (2004) which declared the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes unconstitutional
		- The Court held that sub-classification within SCs does not violate Article 341 and, in fact, promotes substantive equality by ensuring equitable distribution of reservation benefits among the most marginalized within SCs.
- Demand for reservation by Transgender community
	- As per [[National Human Rights Commission]] report, only 6% of transgender people are formally employed.
	- In **NALSA v. Union of India (2014)**, the Supreme Court directed the government to treat them as socially and educationally backward classes for the purpose of **reservation**
- Conclusion
	- Ramachandra Guha remarks that, "any debate on reservation generates more heat than light"
	- Even Supreme Court has opined that reservation cannot stay for indefinite period.
	- In context of recent Supreme Court judgement of USA in Harvard Case (2023) it has been emphasised that every affirmative action should have a sunset clause.
