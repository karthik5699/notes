## Questions:

1. “<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The tropical Indian Ocean is likely to be in a near-permanent heatwave state.</mark>” Discuss the
	factors responsible for the rapid warming of the Indian Ocean along with its multi-dimensional impacts. 

# Cyclones in Indian Ocean

- Introduction
	- The Indian Ocean, once considered relatively calm compared to the Pacific and Atlantic, is now emerging as a **climate hotspot**, warming faster than the global average
- The Indian Ocean has witnessed several unique cyclonic phenomena in recent years, each characterized by distinct patterns and developments:
	- Cyclone Asna (2024)
		- Most Arabian Sea cyclones form pre-monsoon or post-monsoon. 
		- During the monsoon core months strong vertical wind shear from monsoon circulation usually suppresses cyclones.
		- Now they’re sneaking into **mid-monsoon** like Asna
		- In recent years due to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Indian Ocean warming</mark>, the Arabian Sea has been producing more frequent, stronger, and unseasonal cyclones
	- Twin Cyclones Asani and Karim
		- In 2022, twin cyclones, Asani in the Northern Hemisphere and Karim in the Southern Hemisphere, developed simultaneously. 
		- This rare occurrence was fueled by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)
	- Cyclone Gulab's Transition (2021)
		- Cyclone Gulab originated in the Bay of Bengal and later shifted to the Arabian Sea under the influence of trade winds.
	- Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan (2020)
		- Amphan, a super cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, was one of the most intense storms in recent history. 
		- Its rapid intensification and devastating impact underscored the increasing severity of cyclones in the region
- Consequences
	- Coastal vulnerability
		- Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Odisha, and West Bengal face higher risks of storm surges, erosion, saltwater intrusion
	- Socio-economic impacts
		- Fishing disruptions, port closures, crop damage, power outages, and displacement of coastal populations
- Conclusion
	- The Indian Ocean’s constant heating is a direct outcome of its **geography, climate oscillations, and anthropogenic warming**. 
	- The rise of frequent cyclones, particularly in the Arabian Sea, is a warning bell for India’s coastal future.




## Personal Analysis:

Madden–Julian Oscillation is a planetary-scale disturbance of clouds, rainfall, and winds that moves eastward along the equator every 30–60 days, strongly influencing the Indian monsoon, cyclone activity, and even global climate anomalies
