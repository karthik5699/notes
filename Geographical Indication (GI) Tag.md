## Questions:

1. What do you understand by Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)? Discuss the significance of Geographical Indication (GI) Tag as a form of IPR. What measures are required to strengthen the recognition, protection, and commercialisation of GI Tags in India?

# Geographical Indication (GI) Tag

- Introduction
	- A Geographical Indication (GI) is a legal recognition that a product has a specific quality, reputation, or characteristic that is essentially linked to its geographical origin.
- First principles
	- **Identity principle**: A product’s uniqueness comes from the interaction of geography (soil, climate, resources) and culture (skills, traditional knowledge, methods)
	- **Exclusivity principle**: Only producers from that region can use the name legally.
	- **Trust principle**: GI works like a certification mark; when consumers see “Darjeeling Tea,” they trust it’s authentic
- Significance of Geographical Indication (GI) Tags
	- A Geographical Indication is a form of IPR under the Geographical Indications of Goods Act, 1999
	- Globally, GIs are protected under the **TRIPS Agreement (1995)** of the WTO
	- Cultural & Traditional Value
		- GI tags help preserve traditional knowledge and indigenous practices, such as Madhubani paintings (Bihar), Kullu shawls (Himachal), or Kanjeevaram sarees (Tamil Nadu)
	- Economic Empowerment
		- GI registration enables better price realisation for producers, especially artisans, weavers, and farmers. 
		- Example: Darjeeling Tea or Basmati rice fetched higher exports due to GI protection.
	- Rural Livelihood & Women Empowerment
		- Many GI products like Aranmula Kannadi or Kondapalli toys involve women and marginalised communities
- Challenges
	- Low Awareness among producers and consumers about GI benefits
	- Weak enforcement and inadequate legal protection: Fake “Darjeeling tea” often outnumbers the real one
	- Sometimes multiple regions claim the same product (e.g., Basmati rice dispute between India & Pakistan).
	- A GI tag alone doesn’t guarantee markets—it must be backed by branding, distribution, and quality control
- Measures to Strengthen GI Recognition and Commercialisation
	- Create state-level GI facilitation centres to assist in registration, legal protection, and export support
	- Conduct GI literacy campaigns in rural areas through Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Panchayats, and NGOs
	- Strengthen cooperation under WIPO and TRIPS Council to address global counterfeiting of Indian GIs
	- Provide GI development grants, branding support, packaging innovation, and quality testing through MSME schemes, SFURTI (Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries), and Khadi Commission
- Conclusion
	- GI Tags are not merely economic tools they are cultural assets that protect India’s rich diversity and empower local communities. 
	- While India has registered over 500 GI products, the real challenge lies in translating this recognition into economic value, global recognition, and rural prosperity
