# Indian Climate Seasons

- The Monsoon Climate of India has four distinct seasons:
	- Winter Season: November to March
		- During the winter season, the sun’s apparent path is to the south of the equator. January is the coldest month during this season.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250814162254.png]]
		- The weather is marked by clear skies, pleasant weather, low temperature, low humidity, a high range of temperature, and cool and slow northeast trade winds
		- High air pressure prevails over large parts of north-west India due to low temperatures coupled with divergence induced by the ridge of the Sub-Tropical Jet Stream (STJ). 
		- In comparison, South India experiences lower pressure.
		- Western Disturbances in Winter Season
			- The spell of fine weather over northwestern and northern India is often broken due to the inflow of western disturbances.
			- These disturbances intensify over Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana before moving eastwards across the sub-Himalayan belt up to Arunachal Pradesh.
			- They bring light rain in the Indus-Ganga plains and snowfall in the Himalayan belt
		- Tropical Cyclones in the Winter Season
			- ![[Pasted image 20250814162719.png]]
			- This is the season with the least tropical cyclone activity.
			- The frequency of tropical cyclones decreases with the advancement of the season. This is due to low sea surface temperature and exit of ITCZ farthest south.
			- However, some cyclones may still form in the Bay of Bengal, bringing heavy rainfall to Tamil Nadu.
		- Precipitation in Winter Season
			- The retreating winter monsoons pick up some moisture while crossing the Bay of Bengal and cause winter rainfall in Tamil Nadu, south Andhra Pradesh, south-east Karnataka 
			- Most of it occurs along the south-eastern coast of Tamil Nadu and adjoining parts of Andhra Pradesh.
			- The western disturbances also cause a little rainfall in north-west India.
	- Summer Season in India (March to June)
		- The summer season in India prevails from March to June. 
		- It is characterized by high temperatures and low humidity. 
		- It is sometimes referred to as the pre-monsoon period.
		- Temperature
			- The southern parts of the country are distinctly warmer in March and April, whereas, in June, north India has higher temperatures.
			- The diurnal range of temperature is also very high
			- The strong northwesterly winds (caused by a strong divergence in northwest India) with a long land journey over hot regions check the onward march of the sea breeze over the eastern coastal belt and create heatwave conditions over Odisha and Andhra Pradesh
		- The pressure in Summer Season
			- The atmospheric pressure is low all over the country due to high temperatures. 
			- But strong dynamically induced divergence over north-west India prevents the onset of south-west monsoons.
		- Winds in Summer Season
			- Loo
				- Loo winds originate over the Iranian, Baloch, and Thar deserts.
				- In May and June, the high temperature in northwest India builds a steep pressure gradient, causing strong, hot, and dust-laden loo winds to blow.
			- Andhis
				- The strong dust storms resulting from the convective phenomena are locally known as andhis (blinding storms). They move like a solid wall of dust and sand.
				- Such dust storms are common in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu region, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. They are short-lived.
		- Norwesters and Thunderstorms in Summer Season
			- In West Bengal and the adjoining areas of Jharkhand, Odisha, and Assam, the direction of squalls is mainly from the northwest, and they are called norwesters. 
			- The rainfall brought by the norwesters is known as the spring storm showers
			- They are sometimes useful for growing tea, jute, and rice. In Assam, these storms are known as Tea Showers and Barodoli Chheerha
			- The period of maximum occurrence of these storms is the month of Vaisakh (mid-March to mid-April), and hence, they are locally known as Kalabaisakhis, the black storms or a mass of dark clouds of Vaiasakha.
		- Convectional Thunderstorms in the Summer Season
			- In the south, thunderstorms occur in Kerala and adjoining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, particularly during evenings and nights.
			- In Karnataka, they are called cherry blossoms or blossom showers due to their effect on the coffee plantations.
			- Such showers are called mango showers in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh because they are very beneficial to mango crops.
		- Precipitation in Summer Season
			- This season is not totally rainless
			- The norwesters bring some rainfall in Assam, West Bengal, and Odisha with high intensity of rainfall. 
			- Coastal areas of Kerala and Karnataka receive rainfall from thunderstorms.
	- Rainy Season – South-West Monsoon Season
		- Occurs from June to mid-September.
		- The sudden onset of South-West Monsoons leads to a significant fall in temperature (3° to 6 °C)
		- There is a rise in temperature whenever there is a break in the monsoons
		- Pressure and Winds during South-West Monsoon Season
			- Low-pressure conditions prevail over northwest India due to high temperatures
			- ITCZ (monsoon trough) lies along the Ganga plain and shifts location frequently depending on the weather conditions.
			- The atmospheric pressure increases steadily southwards.
			- Over the peninsular region, due to the pressure gradient between north and south, winds blow in a southwest-to-northeast direction from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
			- These winds change direction in the Indo-Gangetic plain, where they move from east to west
		- Rainfall during South-West Monsoon Season
			- This season contributes three-fourths of the total annual rainfall, with the average rainfall over the plains of India being about 87%.
			- The advance of the monsoon is much faster in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea.
			- The normal date of onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala, i.e. the first place of entry in the mainland of India is 1st June.
		- Break in the South-West Monsoons
			- The breaks are believed to be caused by the northward shifting of the monsoon trough to the foothills of the Himalayas.
			- This leads to a sharp decrease in rainfall over most parts of the country but increases along the sub-Himalayan regions and the southern slopes of the Himalayas, parts of Northeast India, and the southeast peninsula.
		- Depressions in South-West Monsoon Season
			- A major part of the south-west monsoon rainfall is generated by depressions (intense low-pressure systems) originating in the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and sometimes even over land
			- Most of the rainfall in central and northern parts of the country is caused by these depressions.
	- South-West Monsoon – Arabian Sea branch and Bay of Bengal branch
		- ![[Pasted image 20250814173840.png]]
		- Monsoon winds beyond south Kerala progress in the form of two branches viz. the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch.
		- On reaching the foothills of the Himalayas, the Bay branch is deflected westward by the Himalayan barrier, and it advances up the Gangetic plain.
		- The two branches merge with each other mostly around Delhi to form a single current. Both the branches reach Delhi more or less at the same time.
		- By the end of June, the monsoons are usually established in most parts of the country
		- The Arabian Sea branch of the monsoon is much more powerful than the Bay of Bengal branch for two reasons:
			- The Arabian Sea is larger than the Bay of Bengal, and
			- The entire Arabian Sea current advances towards India, whereas only a part of the Bay of Bengal current, enters India, the remainder proceeding to Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.
		- Arabian Sea Branch
			- Stream 1
				- The first stream strikes the west coast of India and gives extremely heavy rainfall of over 250 cm
				- It strikes perpendicular to the Western Ghats, causing plentiful Orographic Rainfall
				- Rainfall is drastically reduced to about 30-50 cm on the leeward side of the crest
			- Stream 2
				- The second stream enters the Narmada-Tapti troughs (narrow rift valley) and reaches central India. 
				- It does not cause much rain near the coast due to the absence of major orographic obstacles across the rift.
			- Stream 3
				- The third stream moves parallel to the Aravalli Range without causing much rainfall. Consequently, the whole of Rajasthan is a desert area.
		- Bay of Bengal Branch
			- Stream 1
				- The first stream crosses the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta and reaches Meghalaya, where the orographic effect results in intense rainfall.
				- Cherrapunji & Mawsynram receive heavy rainfall
			- Stream 2
				- The second stream of the Bay of Bengal branch moves along Himalayan foothills as they are deflected to the west by the Himalayas and bring widespread rainfall to the Ganga plain.
	- North-East Monsoon Season – Retreating Monsoon Season
		- The North-East Monsoon Season begins with the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon (mid- September – November)
		- Unlike the sudden burst of the advancing monsoons, the withdrawal is rather gradual and takes about three months
		- With the retreat of the monsoons, the clouds disappear, and the sky becomes clear.
		- Most severe and devastating tropical cyclones originate in the Indian seas, especially in the Bay of Bengal.
		- October-November is the main rainy season in Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of Andhra Pradesh to the south of the Krishna delta as well as a secondary rainy period for Kerala.
