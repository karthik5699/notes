# Illegal Migration

- Introduction
	- Illegal migration is the cross-border movement of people in violation of the immigration laws of the destination country. 
	- For India, it presents a complex challenge with significant security, economic, and demographic implications, primarily from neighbours like Bangladesh and Myanmar.
- Reasons for Illegal Migration:
	- **Political and Social Instability (Push Factor):** 
		- Persecution of ethnic and religious minorities, such as the **Rohingyas in Myanmar** and historically, the **Chakmas in Bangladesh**, forces them to seek refuge in India.
	- **Economic Disparities (Pull Factor):** 
		- India's relatively stable economy and better employment opportunities act as a significant pull for individuals from economically stressed neighbouring regions.
	- **Environmental Causes:** 
		- Climate change-induced phenomena like sea-level rise and riverbank erosion in low-lying areas of Bangladesh create "climate refugees."
	- **Enabling Factors:** 
		- Porous international borders with difficult terrain (riverine, hilly), coupled with strong historical and ethno-linguistic ties across the border, facilitate such movement.
- A Multi-Pronged Strategy:
	- **Border Management:** 
		- Strengthen border infrastructure through comprehensive fencing and technological solutions using tools like the **Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS)**.
	- **Legal Framework:** 
		- Enacting a national law on refugees and asylum seekers is crucial to differentiate between economic migrants and those fleeing persecution, upholding the principle of **non-refoulement**.
	- **Diplomatic Engagement:** 
		- Proactively engage with source countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar to address the root causes of migration and work towards formal repatriation agreements.
- Conclusion
	- India’s approach must be a pragmatic balance between safeguarding national security and upholding humanitarian obligations
