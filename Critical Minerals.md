# Critical Minerals

![[Pasted image 20250912145900.png]]

- Introduction
	- A mineral is labelled as critical when the risk of supply shortage and associated impact on the economy is (relatively) higher than the other raw materials.
- Significance of Critical Minerals
	- Environment 
		- Crucial for renewable energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines
		- Also, crucial for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)
	- National Security 
		- Essential for India's defense sector, including missile systems, aerospace, and communication technologies
	- Economic & Electronic 
		- Shift to electric vehicles (EVs) requires lithium-ion batteries
		- Essential for **semiconductor chips** in smartphones, computers, and communication devices
- Status in India
	- India has identified a list of 30 critical minerals essential for its economic growth and technological development.
	- Some of these minerals are Antimony, beryllium, cobalt, copper, graphite etc.
	- Among these India has sufficient reserves for copper, graphite, rare earths etc.
	- However it is dependent on the imports for Lithium, cobalt, germanium, Indium, Selenium etc
	- The Geological Survey of India has identified that Reasi Lithium Block in Jammu and Kashmir has 5.9 million tonnes of lithium reserves
- How India can secure the supply chain of Critical minerals?
	- Accelerate Domestic Mining: 
		- India is auctioning critical mineral blocks (e.g., lithium in Jammu & Kashmir, rare earths in Karnataka and Rajasthan) to attract both public and private investment in exploration and extraction.
	- Bilateral and Multilateral Agreements: 
		- Secure long-term supply through joint ventures, and diplomatic engagement with resource-rich countries such as Australia, Argentina, Chile, and African nations.
			- Example: The Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL) is acquiring stakes in lithium and cobalt mines in Australia and Argentina to ensure steady supply
- Roadblocks to India's Critical Mineral Security
	- Limited Domestic Reserves: 
		- India does not have many critical mineral reserves
	- Challenges in Exploration: 
		- Many critical minerals are deep-seated, requiring high-risk investments in exploration and advanced mining technologies. 
	- Environmental Concerns: 
		- Mining and processing of critical minerals often have significant environmental footprint resulting in protests from local population and environmental groups
	- Inadequate recycling infrastructure: 
		- Recycling of critical minerals from e-waste is underdeveloped, with the sector remaining largely unorganized and inefficient
- Initiatives by Government to Strengthen the Critical Minerals Sector
	- National Critical Mineral Mission (2025)
		- To secure India's critical mineral supply chain by ensuring mineral availability from domestic and foreign sources
		- It will encompass all stages of the value chain, including mineral exploration, mining, beneficiation, processing, and recovery from end-of-life products.
	- Mines and Minerals Amendment Act, 2023: 
		- It enables exploration and mining of critical minerals.
	- Geological Survey of India (GSI): 
		- Conducting extensive exploration for lithium, rare earths, and other critical minerals.
	- India-Australia critical minerals investment partnership ($5.8 billion commitment)
