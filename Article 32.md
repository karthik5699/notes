## Questions:



# Article 32

- Introduction
	- Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, often termed the "<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">heart and soul of the Constitution</mark>" by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, guarantees the Right to Constitutional Remedies.
	- This article serves as the ultimate mechanism through which citizens can directly approach the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights
- Constitutional Basis and Transformative Role
	- Article 32(1) explicitly guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of fundamental rights
	- Writ Jurisdiction: 
		- Article 32(2) empowers the Supreme Court to issue various writs—including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari—for the purpose of enforcing these rights
	- In the landmark Kesavananda Bharati (1973) case, Article 32 was identified as part of the basic structure of the Constitution
	- Public Interest Litigation (PIL): 
		- From the 1980s onwards, Article 32 was expanded through Public Interest Litigations, allowing non-traditional litigants to secure rights for marginalized groups
- **Interplay with the Doctrine of Res Judicata**
	- The intersection of Article 32 with the principle of res judicata (a matter already judged) creates a dynamic tension in Indian constitutionalism.
	- Res Judicata prevents the re-litigation of issues already decided by a competent court between the same parties
	- Article 32 envisions unrestricted, direct access to the Supreme Court for rights enforcement, while res judicata imposes limits on repetitive litigation to ensure judicial economy
	- Indian jurisprudence has applied res judicata with flexibility, preventing frivolous claims but allowing re-litigation in cases of fresh cause, natural justice violations, or continuing wrongs (e.g., environmental degradation)
- Implications for Constitutionalism and Governance
	- Constitutional Supremacy: 
		- Article 32 reinforces the idea that the Constitution represents a higher normative authority, not legislative supremacy
	- Checks and Balances: 
		- Empowering the Supreme Court, to enforce fundamental rights acts as a counter-majoritarian check on parliamentary overreach and executive actions
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, Article 32 is a cornerstone of India's constitutional framework, ensuring that fundamental rights are not mere declarations but enforceable guarantees.
