# The assembly was the Congress and the Congress was India


- Introduction
	- In terms of political parties, Congress dominated the assembly occupying as many as 82% of the seats in the assembly after partition. 
	- However, the Congress itself was such a diverse party that it managed to accommodate almost all shades of opinion within it.
- Several Factors
	- **Numerical Dominance**: 
		- The Indian National Congress secured an overwhelming majority of 208 out of 296 elected seats in the Constituent Assembly, which were allocated to British Indian provinces.
	- **Muslim League Boycott**: 
		- The Muslim League's decision to boycott the Assembly, on the grounds of its opposition to a united India, further cemented Congress's position as the virtually sole hegemonic force
	- **Pan-Indian Reach and Anti-Colonial Leadership**: 
		- By the 1940s, the Congress had evolved into a mass political party with a pan-Indian reach. 
		- Its successful leadership of the anti-colonial nationalist movement and its negotiations with the British during the transfer of power solidified its centrality in the Assembly and its claim to represent the nation
- However,
	- **Internal Pluralism within the Congress**: 
		- While Congress had hegemony, the Constituent Assembly was far from monolithic or ideologically uniform. 
		- Within the Congress itself, there existed a **multiplicity of ideological positions**, ranging from Jawaharlal Nehru's socialism to Sardar Patel's conservatism, and from Rajendra Prasad's religious nationalism to B.R. Ambedkar's constitutional radicalism
	- **Representation of Diverse Voices**: 
		- Despite Congress dominance, the Assembly included a variety of voices and interests from different social and religious groups. 
		- Members from **Scheduled Castes (like Dr. B.R. Ambedkar), Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, and Anglo-Indians** were present
		- Only 15 women members were part of constituent assembly
	- The Principle of Deliberation
		- The Constituent Assembly functioned for nearly three years, engaging in **robust debates on crucial issues** like federalism, minority rights, language, and social reform. 
		- It involved detailed committee work and procedural integrity, indicating a deliberative rather than a purely majoritarian imposition
- **Criticisms of the "Congress was India" claim** often point to the centralization of power in the hands of leaders like Nehru and Patel, which allegedly led to the marginalization of subaltern and alternative voices, particularly those of Dalits, women, and linguistic minorities
- Conclusion
	- The Constituent Assembly, despite being Congress-dominated, was characterized by **significant internal pluralism, vigorous deliberation, and a genuine commitment to crafting a comprehensive, inclusive, and transformative constitutional framework**
