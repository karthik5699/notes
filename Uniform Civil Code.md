## Questions:

1. Discuss the possible factors that inhibit India from enacting for its citizens a uniform civil code as provided for in the Directive Principles of State Policy.

# Uniform Civil Code

- Introduction
	- The debate surrounding a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) in India is a longstanding and <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">complex issue deeply intertwined with constitutional principles, personal laws, gender equality, and national integration</mark>. 
	- The Constitution of India embodies an ideal (Art 44) that the state should endeavour to secure a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) across India.
- Core of the Debate: Personal Laws vs. Legal Uniformity
	- India currently operates with religion-specific personal laws that govern matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and succession for different religious communities (e.g., Hindu Marriage Act, Muslim Personal Law)
	- The existence of these diverse personal laws creates <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">a dual legal system</mark> that sometimes conflicts with constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination
	- The push for a UCC aims to replace these religion-specific laws with a single set of secular laws applicable to all citizens, irrespective of their religious affiliation
- Arguments in favour of UCC
	- Proponents often frame the UCC as a necessary step towards gender justice, arguing that many personal laws contain discriminatory provisions against women.
	- Implementing a UCC, grounded in modern principles of equality, could ensure equal rights for women in civil matters
	- A uniform law could foster national integration by reducing identity-based legal distinctions among citizens.
- Arguments Against UCC (Resistance from Minority Communities)
	- Minority communities, particularly Muslims, have often resisted the UCC, viewing it as an infringement on their religious identity and cultural autonomy. 
	- They perceive it as an attempt to homogenize diverse cultural practices under a dominant legal framework.
	- Although aimed at gender justice, it gets framed politically as "Hindu majoritarian assertions against Muslim minority rights"
- Shah Bano Case (1985)
	- Shah Bano Begum case brought the debate on a Uniform Civil Code to the forefront of national discourse
	- In the case, Supreme Court granted Shah Bano maintenance under secular law (CrPC), overruling limits of Muslim personal law.
	- While seen by many as a vindication of women's rights, the Court's appeal for a UCC was "counterproductive" and introduced skepticism among some Muslims who feared it would mean a majoritarian code
- Conclusion
	- In essence, the Uniform Civil Code remains a **highly contentious issue in India**, with the judiciary consistently advocating for its implementation for reasons of gender equality and national integration, while the legislature has largely shied away from enacting it due to deep-seated concerns about minority rights, religious freedom, and potential political backlash
- Way forward
	- 21st Law Commission of India's (2018) recommendations regarding the Uniform Civil Code
		- UCC neither necessary nor desirable at this stage
			- Diversity in cultures and personal practices isn’t discrimination—it’s a sign of a vibrant democracy
		- Focus on equality within, not between, communities
			- The Commission emphasized reforming each community’s personal laws to ensure gender justice
