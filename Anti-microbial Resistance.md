# Anti-microbial Resistance

_Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)_ refers to the ability of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites to resist the effects of medications that once could successfully treat them. Globally, about 5 million people are dying of conditions related to anti-microbial resistance each year. It is recognized by the **WHO** as one of the top 10 global public health threats.

#### Major factors contributing to AMR:
- Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: 
	- Industrial waste from the production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for antibiotics
	- **NITI Aayog (2021)** identified “environmental contamination from pharmaceutical industry” as a priority area for AMR regulation
- Agriculture: 
	- Overuse of antibiotics for growth in sectors like livestock and aquaculture
- Healthcare Facilities: 
	- Improper management of unused medications, patient excretion, and disposal of expired drugs

#### Why AMR is a Global Health Threat?
- According to a World Bank report, AMR could lead to an additional US $1 trillion in healthcare costs by 2050
- AMR makes common infections like TB, pneumonia harder to treat
	- India accounts for the highest burden of multidrug-resistant TB
- Improper disposal of antibiotics contaminates the environment, creating reservoirs for resistance genes
- There is an inadequate research and development pipeline for alternative treatments to combat rising resistance levels

#### Measures and Way Forward to Combat AMR
- Jeddah Commitments: 
	- These commitments (a non-legally binding instrument) provide a comprehensive framework for global action to combat AMR through a One Health approach
	- One Health Approach: Recognizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health to address AMR holistically
- Sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming, can limit the use of antibiotics in livestock and aquaculture
- Healthcare facilities should implement antibiotic stewardship programs for responsible antibiotic use
	- Avoid giving antibiotics for minor or viral infections
	- Choose the _right_ antibiotic at the _right_ dose for the _right_ time
- Bacteriophages instead of antibiotics
	- About a century ago, phages were beginning to be used against bacterial infections, but antibiotics superseded them once they were discovered
	- Due to AMR, the world is now rediscovering phages & relevant research is ongoing
