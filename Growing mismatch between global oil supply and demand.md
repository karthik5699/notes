# Growing mismatch between global oil supply and demand

- Introduction
	- According to IEA Oil 2025 report, the global oil supply is projected to outpace demand growth in the coming years.
	- The global oil market is witnessing heightened volatility due to geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine war, Middle East instability) and post-pandemic demand resurgence. 
- For India, the worldâ€™s third-largest oil importer, navigating this mismatch is crucial to ensuring energy security, economic stability, and strategic autonomy
	- Strategic Diversification of Import Sources
		- Reducing over-dependence on West Asian oil (~60%) by expanding ties with Russia, Latin America (e.g., Brazil, Venezuela), and Africa (e.g., Nigeria, Angola)
		- Recent example: India increased Russian oil imports post-Ukraine war due to discounted crude
	- Strengthening Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR)
		- Enhance SPR capacity (currently ~39 million barrels) to cover at least 90 days of imports, as per IEA recommendations
	- Transition to Electric Vehicles
		- Faster EV adoption through FAME II, and incentivising fuel-efficient transport modes.
	- Accelerating Renewable Energy and Biofuel Transition
		- Achieve 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 (as per COP26 commitment).
		- Scale up ethanol blending to 20% by 2025 under the National Policy on Biofuels
		- Promote green hydrogen under the National Green Hydrogen Mission
	- International Collaboration and Strategic Diplomacy
		- Active participation in IEA, IEEFA, and forums like G20, BRICS for energy cooperation and supply chain resilience
		- Bilateral agreements for long-term LNG and oil contracts with nations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the US
	- Domestic Exploration and Production
		- Revamp NELP and HELP to attract private investment
		- Focus on under-explored regions in the Northeast and offshore basins
