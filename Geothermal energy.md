	- Potential Sites:
		- Puga Valley (Ladakh): Promising site with significant geothermal potential.
		- Geothermal Provinces: Himalayas, Sohana, West Coast, Cambay, and Godavari regions.
	- Key challenges
		- Relatively high technology and capital costs.
		- Drilling can release harmful gases and may trigger minor seismic activity.
		- Requires careful management to re-inject fluids and maintain reservoir pressure
		- Licensing and regulatory processes.
	- India's Initiatives
		- Mapping geothermal potential through the Geothermal Atlas of India, 2022.
