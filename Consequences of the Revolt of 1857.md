## Questions:

1. Explain how the Uprising of 1857 constitutes an important watershed in the evolution of British policies towards colonial India.


# Consequences of the Revolt of 1857

The revolt of 1857 marks a turning point in the history of India. It led to far-reaching changes in the system of administration and the policies of the British Government.

1. Transfer of Power
	- the most immediate and fundamental change was the transfer of power from the East India Company to the British Crown
	- the Act for the Better Government of India, passed on August 2, 1858, abolished Company rule and declared Queen Victoria as the sovereign of British India
	- this meant the British government accepted direct responsibility for ruling India
2. Administrative Restructuring
	- the appointment of a Secretary of State for India (a member of the British cabinet answerable to Parliament) to oversee Indian affairs, assisted by an India Council
	- The Governor-General in India was given the additional title of Viceroy, becoming the personal representative of the Crown
	- Authority became concentrated with the Secretary of State in London, increasing the influence of British industrialists and merchants on policy in India
3. Reorganization of the Army
	- the Revolt, particularly the mutiny of sepoys, showed the British they could no longer rely solely on Indian loyalty
	- the number of Indian soldiers was drastically reduced, while the number of European soldiers was increased
	- Units were created on the basis of caste/community/region, and recruitment favoured 'martial races' (like Gurkhas, Sikhs, Pathans) who had remained loyal, while soldiers from areas involved in the revolt (Awadh, Bihar, etc.) were declared non-martial
	- Strict European monopoly was maintained over key departments like artillery, tanks, and armed corps
4. Policy Towards Princely States
	- Recognizing the loyalty of many princes during the Revolt (seeing them as "breakwaters in political storms"), the policy of annexation was abandoned
	- Rulers were assured that their territory would not be annexed, and their right to adopt heirs was respected
	- The British government also asserted the right to interfere in the internal affairs of these states
5. Shift in Approach to Governance and Society
	- The British decided to abandon their earlier reformist zeal
	- They began to side with socially orthodox and conservative elements, encouraging casteism and communalism
	- A "naked policy of divide and rule" was adopted, putting groups against each other. 
		- After initially repressing Muslims, the British decided after 1870 to use educated Muslims against the rising tide of nationalism

In essence, the 1857 Uprising shattered the illusion of stability under the East India Company and revealed the widespread discontent across different sections of society, including the military. This forced the British Crown to take direct control and fundamentally reshape its administrative, military, and political strategies to secure its hold over India for the future.
