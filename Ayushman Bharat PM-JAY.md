# Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY

- Introduction
	- Launched on 2018, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) has been a cornerstone of India's commitment to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
	- Universal Health Care --> quality health care should be guaranteed to all members of the community irrespective of their ability to pay.
- Key Features
	- World’s Largest Health Assurance Scheme
	- Prioritising the poorest 40% of the population based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011
	- Health Coverage of ₹5 Lakh
	- In 2023-24, PMJAY covered 58.8 crore individuals with an annual budget of 12,000 crores
	- Beneficiaries can access cashless treatment at any empanelled public or private hospital across India
	- the eligibility criteria were expanded to include ASHA workers, Anganwadi Workers, Anganwadi Helpers, and their families
	- Free Health Coverage for All Seniors 70+ (Vay Vandana Card)
	- Cashless Access to Healthcare
	- Mitigating Catastrophic Health Expenditure
- Challenges/Criticism
	- The assumption that Universal Health Care can be achieved by expanding health insurance is questionable. 
	- Health insurance promotes for-profit medicine
		- A study found that scheme made little difference to hospitalisation rates but increases utilisation of private hospitals
	- Health insurance tilts the health-care system towards hospitalisation
		- Investments in primary and outpatient care may be more urgent
	- Utilisation hurdles especially among disadvantaged sections
		- Despite 80% of the population being covered under PMJAY and other State Health Insurance Programs
		- Lack of awareness about the scheme and how to use it
	- Health insurance schemes create issues of discrimination between insured and uninsured patients
		- Private players prefer an uninsured patient; while public hospitals prefer insured patients
- Way Forward
	- India's profit-driven healthcare system reflects decades of under-investment in public health facilities.
	- Public Expenditure on Health was as low of 1.3% of GDP (2022) compared with world average of 6.1%.
	- The need of the hour is to increase public expenditure on health to align with the nation's commitment to SDG3 and ensuring that "no one is left behind."
