# Volcanism

A volcano is a vent or a fissure in the crust from which lava (molten rock), ash, gases, rock fragments erupt from a magma chamber below the surface. Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock, pyroclastics and volcanic gases to the surface through a vent.

- Causes of Volcanism
	- There is a huge temperature difference between the inner layers and the outer layers of the earth due to the differential amount of radioactivity
	- This temperature difference gives rise to convectional currents in the mantle.
	- The convection currents in the mantle create convergent and divergent boundaries
	- At the divergent boundary, molten, semi-molten and sometimes gaseous material appears on earth at the first available opportunity
	- At the convergent boundary, the subduction of denser plate creates magma at high pressure which will escape to the surface in the form of violent eruptions
- Volcanism Lava types
	- Acidic or Composite lava
		- These lavas are highly viscous
		- They are light-coloured, of low density, and have a high percentage of silica.
		- They flow slowly and seldom travel far before solidifying
		- The resultant volcanic cone is therefore stratified (hence the name stratovolcano) and steep-sided.
		- The rapid solidifying of lava in the vent obstructs the flow of the out-pouring lava, resulting in loud explosions, throwing out many volcanic bombs or pyroclasts
	- Basic or Basaltic or Shield lava
		- These are the hottest lavas, about 1,000 Â°C and are highly fluid
		- They are dark coloured basalt, rich in iron and magnesium but poor in silica.
		- They flow out of volcanic vent quietly and are not very explosive.
		- They affect extensive areas, spreading out as thin sheets over great distances before they solidify.
		- The resultant volcano is gently sloping with a wide diameter and forms a flattened shield or dome
- Distribution of Earthquakes and Volcanoes across the World
	- Most known volcanic activity and the earthquakes occur along converging plate margins and mid-oceanic ridges.
	- It is said that nearly 70% of earthquakes occur in the Circum-Pacific belt
	- Another 20% of earthquakes take place in the Mediterranean-Himalayan belt including Asia Minor, the Himalayas and parts of north-west China
	- Only 10% to 20% of all volcanic activity is above the sea, and terrestrial volcanic mountains are small when compared to their submarine counterparts
- Volcanism along the Pacific Ring of Fire
	- Circum-Pacific region popularly termed the â€˜Pacific Ring of Fireâ€™, has the greatest concentration of active volcanoes
	- Includes famous volcanoes like **Mount Fuji (Japan)**, **Mount St. Helens (USA**
- Countries with most volcanoes
	- United States >> Russia >> Indonesia >> Iceland >> Japan
- Mediterranean volcanism
	- Volcanoes of the Mediterranean region are mainly associated with the Alpine folds, e.g. Vesuvius, Stromboli (Light House of the Mediterranean) and those of the Aegean islands.
- Barren Island (only active volcano in India) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
- Destructive Effects of Volcanism
	- Showers of cinders and bombs can cause damage to life
	- Tsunamis can be generated in large water bodies due to violent eruptions
	- The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen fluoride.
	- Ash and chemicals can contaminate rivers and groundwater.
	- Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulphur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote depletion of the Earthâ€™s ozone layer.
- Positive Effects of Volcanism
	- Volcanism creates new fertile landforms like islands, plateaus, volcanic mountains etc. E.g. Deccan traps.
	- The volcanic ash and dust are very fertile for farms and orchards.
	- Mineral resources, particularly metallic ores are brought to the surface by volcanoes.
	- In the vicinity of active volcanoes, waters in depth are heated from contact with hot magma giving rise to springs and geysers
	- The heat from the earthâ€™s interior in areas of volcanic activity is used to generate geothermal electricity.
	- The Puga valley in Ladakh region and Manikaran (Himachal Pradesh) are promising spots in India for the generation of geothermal electricity
