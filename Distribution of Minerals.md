# Distribution of Minerals

- Introduction
	- A mineral is a natural substance of organic or inorganic origin with definite chemical and physical properties.
- Mineral distribution across the world
	- Iron Ore: 
		- The primary raw material for making steel, iron ore is foundational to global industry and infrastructure. 
		- Its largest deposits are found in ancient sedimentary rock formations.
		- Australia is the largest producer. 
		- Other major producing countries include Brazil, China, and India.
	- Bauxite: 
		- The main source of aluminium, bauxite is a sedimentary rock formed over long periods
		- The world's leading producer is Australia. Significant production also comes from Guinea, China, and Brazil.
	- Copper: 
		- Essential for electrical wiring, electronics, and construction, copper deposits are often associated with volcanic and tectonic activity along plate boundaries.
		- The top producer is Chile. 
		- Other key producing nations are Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and China
	- Manganese: 
		- A critical alloy used to make steel stronger and more resistant to wear
		- The largest producer by a significant margin is South Africa
	- Diamond: 
		- The hardest known natural material, valued for both industrial applications and jewellery. 
		- Major deposits are found in ancient, stable continental crusts known as cratons, within volcanic pipes called kimberlites.
		- The leading producer by volume is Russia. 
		- Botswana, Canada, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are also major producers
	- Gold: 
		- A precious metal used in jewellery, finance, and electronics. 
		- It is found in a wide variety of geological settings, including quartz veins (lode deposits) and river beds (placer deposits).
		- The world's top producer is China. 
		- Other significant gold-producing countries include Australia, Russia, and the United States.
