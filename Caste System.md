# Caste System

- Introduction
	- Contrary to the modernization theory that predicted the demise of caste with urbanization, caste has proven to be resilient by reinventing itself in Urban India. 
	- It has transformed from a system of ritual hierarchy into a dynamic tool for networking, association, and political mobilization
- Reinvention through Networks
	- **Economic Networks:** 
		- Caste-based business communities (e.g., Marwari traders) and informal job referral networks in sectors like IT and trade.
	- **Social Networks:** 
		- The proliferation of caste-specific matrimonial websites (e.g., ReddyMatrimony, BrahminMatrimony) and housing societies that discreetly favour certain caste groups.
- Reinvention through Associations:
	- Caste associations have shifted from ritual-focused bodies to modern secular organizations that act as pressure groups and support systems
	- **Example:** 
		- The Nadar Mahajana Sangam in Tamil Nadu transitioned from a social reform body to running educational institutions, banks, and businesses, empowering the community. 
		- Similarly, associations like the Jat Mahasabha lobby for political and economic interests like reservations.
- Reinvention through Electoral Mobilization:
	- In the competitive landscape of urban politics, caste has become a primary unit for electoral mobilization.
	- **Example:** 
		- Political parties meticulously calculate caste demographics in urban constituencies before distributing tickets. 
		- Caste associations actively bargain with parties for representation and influence voting patterns
- Conclusion
	- Thus, caste in urban India is not disappearing but is taking on a new ‘avatar’, as M.N. Srinivas observed. 
	- It has become a crucial axis of identity, competition, and access to resources, posing a significant challenge to the creation of a truly casteless, cosmopolitan society.
