	- They lie in the interiors of the continents
	- Lie in the Westerly wind belt
	- Grasslands are practically treeless due to continentiality

- Steppe Climate
	- Temperature
		- Climate is continental with extremes of temperature.
		- Temperatures vary greatly between summer and winter.
		- The summers are hot and the winters are cold.
	- Precipitation
		- The average rainfall may be taken as about 45 cm, but this varies according to location from 25 cm to 75 cm
- Natural Vegetation of Steppe Climate
	- Grasses
		- Greatest difference from the tropical savanna is that steppes are practically treeless and the grasses are much shorter.
		- The grasses are not only shorter but also wiry(lean, tough) and sparse
- Economic Development of Steppes
	- Wheat and Maize Cultivation
		- Cultivation was unknown just before a century and the region was one of the most sparsely populated parts of the world
		- In recent years, the grasslands have been ploughed up for extensive wheat cultivation and are now the ‘granaries of the world’ (Prairies)
		- In the Prairies, the Argentinian Pampas, the Ukrainian Steppes and the Downs of Australia, agriculture is completely mechanized
