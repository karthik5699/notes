## Questions:

1. Account for the factors influencing the location of semiconductor industries across the world

# Location of Semiconductor industries

- Introduction
	- The global semiconductor industry is geographically concentrated in a few key regions, with East Asia, U.S., South Korea dominating the manufacturing landscape
	- The Union Cabinet has approved four additional semiconductor manufacturing projects under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh & Punjab
- Fundamental factors
	- Access to advanced technology & R&D ecosystems
		- Semiconductors are knowledge-intensive. 
		- You need universities, research labs, and tech companies feeding innovation. 
		- That’s why Silicon Valley, Hsinchu (Taiwan), and Seoul thrive—they have a dense network of engineers, scientists, and suppliers.
	- Highly skilled labour
		- Fabrication plants (fabs) require people who can operate equipment at nanometer precision. 
		- The training pipeline—from STEM education to specialised semiconductor courses—determines where fabs can operate efficiently.
	- Stable and supportive policy environment
		- Governments often make or break the industry through subsidies, tax incentives, and protection from foreign competition
		- CHIPS and Science Act in the US
	- Supply chain integration
		- Chips need raw wafers, gases (e.g., argon, nitrogen), photoresists, precision equipment, packaging facilities, and testing services. 
		- A fab works best where all these inputs can be sourced quickly and reliably.
	- Geopolitical security & strategic considerations
		- Since chips are the backbone of modern defense and tech, nations prefer locations that are politically stable, militarily secure, and ideally within friendly borders
	- Capital investment capacity
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A state-of-the-art fab can cost over $20 billion</mark>. 
		- That means locations need robust financial systems, access to venture capital, and often heavy government co-funding.
	- Energy & water availability
		- Chip fabrication is **energy-hungry** and **water-thirsty**
		- Areas with cheap, reliable electricity and abundant clean water—like Taiwan’s west coast or Oregon in the US—become attractive.
- Distribution in India
	- Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu
- Challenges for India
	- Supply Chain Dependencies: 
		- Heavy reliance on specific regions like Taiwan (which produces 60% of global semiconductors) and South Korea (which provides 100% of advanced chips).
	- Resource Constraints: 
		- Issues include the need for ultra-pure water, stable power sources, and specialized gases.
	- Shortage of Skilled Workforce: 
		- There is a need for more trained professionals in the sector.
- Government Initiatives
	- Indian Semiconductor Mission
- Conclusion
	- As nations seek greater chip autonomy, efforts are underway to rebalance this geographical concentration.
