# Rubber Distribution

- Introduction
	- India is the third largest producer and fourth largest consumer of natural rubber.
	- Thailand is world leading Rubber producer followed by Indonesia
- Global Distribution
	- Asia (dominant ~90% production)
		- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia – traditional leaders, account for bulk of exports
		- India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka – significant producers; India ranks high in consumption.
		- China – major producer but more importantly the largest consumer
	- Africa
		- Liberia, Nigeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon – emerging producers, often plantation-based
	- Latin America
		- Brazil (native origin of rubber) – limited production today due to leaf blight disease.
- India
	- Kerala
		- Accounts for 70% of production
		- Rubber plantations in Kerala face serious challenges due to an invasive pest-fungus association.
		- The parasite involved is identified as the _ambrosia beetle_ (native to South America)
	- Tamil Nadu
	- North-East India
	- Karnataka
- Factors responsible for the location of Natural Rubber Industry
	- Climatic Conditions: 
		- Favourable warm, humid tropical climate 
		- Lateritic soils rich in iron.
	- Labour: 
		- Need skilled labour to collect Latex
	- Disease Resistance: 
		- High-yielding varieties resistant to fungal infections.
- Challenges Facing the Rubber Industry:
	- High Labour Costs: 
		- Expensive skilled labour for rubber tapping makes plantations financially unsustainable.
	- Import Competition: 
		- Cheaper imported rubber lowers domestic prices, further discouraging local production.
	- Production-Consumption Gap: 
		- Increasing tire industry demand widens the gap between rubber production and consumption.
	- Climate Change: 
		- Changing weather, especially in traditional areas like Kerala, poses challenges for rubber cultivation.
- Government Initiatives in the Rubber Sector:
	- Rubber Board (1947)
		- Ensures overall development of the rubber industry in the country.
	- National Rubber Policy 2019: 
		- Supports the entire rubber industry value chain
