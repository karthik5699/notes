## Questions:

1. Why are the world‚Äôs fold mountain systems located along the margins of continents? Bring out the association between the global distribution of Fold Mountains and the earthquakes and volcanoes.

# Classification of Mountains

Classification of mountains on the basis of location
1. Continental mountains
	1. Coastal mountains
		- Rockies,
		- Appalachians,
		- Alpine mountain chains,
		- Western Ghats and
		- Eastern Ghats
	2. Inland mountains
		- Vosges and the Black Forest (Europe),
		- Kunlun, Tienshan, Altai mountains of Asia
		- Urals of Russia, 
		- the Aravallis, Himalayas, the Satpura, and the Maikal of India.
2. Oceanic mountains
	- found on continental shelves and ocean floors
	- Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano in the island of Hawaii

Classification of mountains on the basis of mode of origin
1. Original or Tectonic mountains
	- Are the product of tectonic forces
	- May be categorized into
		- Fold mountains
			- ![[Pasted image 20250819170729.png]]
			- Are formed when sedimentary rock strata in geosynclines are subjected to compressive forces
			- They are the loftiest mountains, and they are generally concentrated along continental margins.
			- The Aravalli Range in India is the oldest fold mountain systems in India
			- Young fold mountains are the Rockies, the Andes, the Alps, the Himalayas, etc.
			- Fold mountains often get earthquakes again and again
			- Most widespread and most important
			- Contain rich mineral sources: tin, copper, gold
		- Block mountains
			- Are created because of faulting on a large scale (when large areas or blocks of earth are broken and displaced vertically or horizontally)
			- When the earth‚Äôs crust bends folding occurs, but when it cracks, faulting takes place
			- The uplifted blocks are termed as horsts, and the lowered blocks are called graben.
			- Vosges in France, the Black Forest in Germany, Vindhya and Satpura in India
			- Rift Valley System
				- The rift valley system and block mountains are two sides of the same tectonic process
				- When the Earth's crust is pulled apart, some blocks sink down to form a rift valley, while others remain up or get pushed up to form block mountains.
				- Example: East African Rift Valley
		- Volcanic Mountains
			- Are formed due to volcanic activity
			- Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Mauna Kea and Mount Fujiyama are examples
			- These are volcanoes which are built up from material ejected from fissures in the earth‚Äôs crust
			- The materials include molten lava, volcanic bombs, cinders, ashes, dust and liquid mud
			- Volcanic mountains are often called mountains of accumulation
			- They are common in the Circum-Pacific belt.
2. Residual mountains
	- Residual mountains (Aravallis in India, Urals in Russia) are the remnants of old fold mountains




## Personal Analysis:

Geosyncline: a large-scale depression in the earth‚Äôs crust containing very thick deposits. E.g. Tethys geosyncline.
