## Questions:

1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India can be most effective when its tasks are adequately supported by other mechanisms that ensure the accountability of a government. In light of the above observation assess the role of NHRC as an effective complement to the judiciary and other institutions in promoting and protecting human rights standards.

# National Human Rights Commission

- Introduction
	- The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is a pivotal institution for upholding human rights. 
	- Its effectiveness, however, is not standalone but is realised best when it functions as an effective complement to Indiaâ€™s wider accountability ecosystem, particularly the judiciary.
- NHRC as a Complement to Judiciary and Other Institutions
	- **Reduces Judicial Burden:** 
		- Through its suo motu cognizance and independent investigations into issues like custodial deaths or manual scavenging, the NHRC acts as a fact-finding body, often laying the groundwork for judicial proceedings and reducing the judiciary's preliminary burden.
	- **Enhances Accessibility to Justice:** 
		- As a more accessible, less formal, and quicker mechanism than courts, the NHRC provides a "poor person's" alternative for grievance redressal, recommending immediate relief and compensation
	- **Systemic and Policy Interventions:** 
		- Unlike courts that are primarily reactive, the NHRC proactively inspects prisons, reviews anti-terror legislation, and provides policy recommendations to the Parliament and executive
	- **Synergy with Civil Society:** 
		- It collaborates with NGOs and activists, amplifying their concerns and lending institutional legitimacy to grassroots human rights campaigns
- Challenges Hindering its Role:
	- Structural Limitations
		- Its recommendations are not binding, making it a 'toothless tiger'
		- It cannot directly investigate violations by armed forces
		- It is barred from taking up cases more than a year old
		- The selection committee's composition raises questions about its political independence
	- Practical limitations
		- Lacking an independent investigative staff, it relies on government agencies which creates conflict of interest
		- It is dependent on the government for funds
- Conclusion
	- To conclude, the NHRC is an indispensable complement rather than a substitute for the judiciary. 
	- Strengthening its powers by making its recommendations binding, as suggested by the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Venkatachaliah Commission</mark>, is crucial for it to fully realise its mandate in conformity with the **Paris Principles**




## Personal Analysis:

The **Paris Principles** are a set of international minimum standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).
