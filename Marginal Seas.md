# Marginal Seas

- Introduction
	- In oceanography, a marginal sea is a sea **partially enclosed** by islands, archipelagos, or peninsulas
	- Some of the major marginal seas include the Arabian Sea, Baltic Sea, Bay of Bengal, Bering Sea, Black Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea
	- Marginal seas, which are generally shallower than open oceans, are more influenced by human activities, river runoff, climate, and water circulation
- Human Impact on marginal seas
	- Marginal seas are more susceptible to pollution than open ocean regions because of the high concentration of human activities near coastlines and rivers
	- Ninety percent of the world’s fisheries exist within coastal waters that are located less than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the shoreline
	- Other human activities that have adversely affected marginal seas include industrial sewage disposal, offshore oil drilling, and accidental releases of pollutants, including petroleum products, radioactive waste, detergents, and plastics
- Phytoplankton Bloom (Algal Bloom) in Marginal Seas
	- ![[Pasted image 20250718161259.png]]
	- The Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea are marginal seas found in proximity to one another. 
	- The colour difference shown here is due to a **phytoplankton bloom** occurring in the Black Sea.
	- Phytoplankton are good as fish feed on them. But when they proliferate indiscriminately, they consume too much oxygen during nights, thus depriving other marine organisms of oxygen.
	- For example, the discharge of domestic sewage leads to elevated nutrient concentrations (particularly phosphates) which can result in harmful algal blooms
- Water Circulation in Marginal Seas
	- Water circulation patterns in marginal seas depend largely on shape of the sea, fresh-water input (e.g., river runoff and precipitation) and evaporation.
	- If river **runoff and precipitation exceed evaporation**, as is the case in the Black and Baltic Seas, the excess fresh water will tend to flow seaward near the sea surface
	- If evaporation exceeds river runoff and precipitation, as in the Mediterranean Sea, the marginal sea water becomes saltier, then sinks and flows towards the less salty open ocean region.
	- Circulation Patterns in
		- Black Sea & Baltic Sea
			- ![[Pasted image 20250718162443.png]]
			- The Black Sea and Baltic Sea basins both possess **sills** that restrict subsurface water circulation
			- While the surface waters of the Black and Baltic Seas are able to flow over the sills and introduce lower salinity water into the open ocean, the flow of the saltier subsurface waters is blocked by these sills
			- This type of subsurface-water restriction often leads to stagnation, which may eventually result in local oxygen depletion.
		- Mediterranean Sea
			- ![[Pasted image 20250718163159.png]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20250718163025.png]]
			- The Mediterranean Sea is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Straits of Gibraltar, to the Black Sea via the Bosporus Strait, and to the Red Sea via the manmade Suez Canal.
			- In Mediterranean Sea evaporation exceeds precipitation and hence salinity increases.
			- Atlantic Ocean water enters this marginal sea through the Straits of Gibraltar as a surface flow. 
			- This ocean water replaces a fraction of the water that evaporates in the eastern Mediterranean Sea
- Bays, gulfs, and Straits
	- Bays, gulfs, and straits are types of water bodies that are contained within a larger body of water near land
	- Bays
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718164155.png]]
		- Bay is a water body surrounded on three sides by land with the fourth side (mouth) wide open towards oceans
		- A bay is usually smaller and less enclosed than a gulf
	- Gulfs
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718165351.png]]
		- A gulf is a large body of water, sometimes with a narrow mouth, that is almost completely surrounded by land. The world’s largest gulf is the Gulf of Mexico
	- Straits
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718165638.png]]
		- A strait is a narrow passageway of water, usually between continents or islands, or between two larger bodies of water.
		- The **Strait of Gibraltar** is probably the world’s most famous strait. It connects the Atlantic Ocean on its west with the Mediterranean Sea on its east.
		- The Strait of Hormuz is located at the **southeastern end of the Persian Gulf**. It is a narrow waterway that can be (and has been) controlled to prevent ships from sailing through the gulf.
		- Choke Point
			- When a body of water such as a strait is capable of being blocked or even closed in order to control transportation routes, the body is called a “choke point.”
			- The Strait of Hormuz has become an important choke point in recent years because of increasing Middle East tensions
	- Isthmus
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718171347.png]]
		- Isthmus is the land-equivalent of a strait. i.e., a narrow strip of land connecting two larger land masses
		- Example: Isthmus of Panama
