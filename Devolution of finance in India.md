# Devolution of finance in India

Devolution of finance, also known as fiscal federalism, refers to the allocation of fiscal rights and responsibilities across different levels of government under a federal arrangement. The Constitution outlines elaborate provisions for the distribution of financial powers and resources between the Union (Central) government and the states, and further extends this to local bodies.

- Constitutional Framework for Financial Relations:
	- Article 268 to 293 in Part XII deal with the financial relations of Centre-state
	- The Indian Constitution distinguishes between the power to levy and collect a tax, and the power to appropriate the proceeds of the tax
- Allocation of Taxing Powers
	- Union List -> Parliament
	- State List -> State Legislature
	- Concurrent List -> Both Parliament and state legislatures
	- Residuary List -> Parliament. Examples include gift tax, wealth tax
- Distribution of Tax Revenue
	- Taxes levied by the Union but collected and appropriated by the States
		- The proceeds levied within a state are assigned to that state and do not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India
	- Taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to the States
		- This includes taxes on the sale or purchase of goods (other than newspapers) in inter-state trade or commerce
		- The net proceeds do not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India and are assigned to the concerned states
	- Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Inter-State Trade or Commerce: 
		- GST on inter-state supplies is levied and collected by the Centre but is divided between the Centre and the States based on the recommendations of the GST Council
	- Taxes levied and collected by the Centre but distributed between the Centre and the States (Article 270)
		- Certain taxes are levied as well as collected by the Union, but their proceeds are divided between the Union and the States in a certain proportion
		- The distribution manner is prescribed by the President based on the Finance Commission's recommendations
	- Surcharge on Certain Taxes and Duties for Central Purposes
		- Parliament can levy surcharges on taxes and duties. The proceeds of these surcharges go exclusively to the Centre, with no share for the states.
- Non-Tax Revenues
	- Centre's Major Sources: Receipts from posts and telegraphs, railways, banking, broadcasting, coinage and currency, central public sector enterprises
	- States' Major Sources: Receipts from irrigation, forests, fisheries, state public sector enterprises
- Grants-in-Aid to the States
	- The Constitution provides for two main types of grants
	- Statutory Grants: 
		- Parliament can make grants to states in need of financial assistance, charged on the Consolidated Fund of India annually.
	- Discretionary Grants: 
		- Both the Centre and states can make grants for any public purpose, even if outside their legislative competence. The Centre uses this provision to aid states financially to achieve plan targets and influence state action for national plans.
- Trends and Issues in Centre-State Financial Relations:
	- Unitary Bias: 
		- Historically, there has been a tendency towards centralisation due to the dominance of the Centre in the financial sphere and states' dependence on Central grants
	- NITI Aayog's Role: 
		- NITI Aayog aims to foster cooperative federalism and move from a "top-down" to a "bottom-up" approach, facilitating a shared vision for national development with active state involvement. 
		- However, it lacks powers to grant discretionary funds, leading to debates on its "transformational" intervention capability
	- GST Impact: 
		- While GST aims for a unified domestic market and increased aggregate revenues, states are concerned about losing their autonomy in taxation due to a uniform rate and the Centre's influence in the GST Council
	- Vertical and Horizontal Imbalances: 
		- Fiscal federalism in India is marked by imbalances in resource allocation between different levels of government and among states
	- Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS): 
		- These schemes, though implemented by states, are designed by the Centre, leading to issues of varying accounting procedures and perceived imposition on states
