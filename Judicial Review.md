# Judicial Review

- Introduction
	- Judicial review is a fundamental concept in constitutional law, empowering courts to examine the legality and constitutionality of legislative and executive actions. 
	- It serves as a crucial check on the powers of the other branches of government, ensuring adherence to constitutional principles and the protection of individual rights
- Core Principles and Scope
	- Judicial review involves the power of courts to strike down laws and executive actions that violate the Constitution. 
	- This is explicitly recognized in India under Articles 32 and 226, which empower the Supreme Court and High Courts to enforce fundamental rights
	- **Constitutional Supremacy**: 
		- In constitutional democracies like India, judicial review underscores the **supremacy of the Constitution** over the legislature. 
		- Unlike the British model of parliamentary sovereignty, where Parliament's power is absolute, the Indian Parliament operates within the bounds of a written Constitution
	- **Rule of Law**: 
		- Judicial review is integral to the **rule of law**, ensuring that all state actions are subject to legal scrutiny
	- **Rights Protection**: 
		- A primary function of judicial review is to safeguard fundamental rights
- **Evolution and Key Doctrines in India**
	- Era of Judicial Restraint (1950s–1970s): 
		- Initially, the judiciary adopted a deferential approach to the legislature and executive, largely adhering to a formalist interpretation of laws
			- E.g. Shankari Prasad case (1951) & Sajjan Singh case (1965)
	- Confrontation and Assertion (1973–1980s): 
		- The Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case was a turning point, introducing the Basic Structure Doctrine which limited Parliament's amending power 
		- This period also saw the Emergency (1975–77), which highlighted judicial vulnerability (e.g., ADM Jabalpur case). 
		- Post-Emergency, the Court reasserted its independence and adopted a more proactive stance, notably through the emergence of Public Interest Litigation (PIL)
	- Institutional Expansion (1990s–2010s): 
		- Judicial activism intensified, with courts increasingly venturing into governance and policy domains. 
			- Education (Unnikrishnan case), Environment (MC Mehta cases) , Corruption (Vineet Narain case), and Electoral reforms (PUCL case), Vishaka Guidelines (1997) 
		- This phase saw the judiciary redefining its institutional autonomy, particularly with the establishment of the Collegium system
	- Contemporary Contestations (2010s–Present): 
		- The judiciary continues to wield significant power, with landmark judgments such as Navtej Singh Johar (2018) (decriminalizing homosexuality), Sabarimala temple entry case, and Justice K. S. Puttaswamy case (2017) (Right to Privacy). 
		- However, this era has also seen intensified criticisms of judicial overreach
			- Striking down of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act in 2015
			- The Supreme Court's cancellation of telecom licenses in the 2G Spectrum case (2012)
- **Challenges and Critiques**
	- **Judicial Overreach**: 
		- A common concern is **judicial overreach** (also called judicial legislation), where courts are perceived to exceed their adjudicative role and venture into policy-making or administrative domains traditionally reserved for the legislature and executive. 
		- Instances include laying down binding guidelines in the absence of legislation (Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, 1997), cancelling telecom licenses (_2G Spectrum Case_, 2012), or diluting existing laws (_Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra_, 2018). 
	- Judicial Review as a "Lawyer's Paradise"
		- Sir Ivor Jennings famously characterized the Indian Constitution as a "lawyer's paradise" due to its extensive length, detail, and the constant need for legal interpretation
		- This complexity necessitates continuous judicial interpretation and arbitration, reinforcing the central role of courts and legal professionals in shaping constitutional governance
	- However,
		- Judicial overreach can be justified as a response to perceived failures of the executive and legislature to uphold their constitutional duties, particularly in protecting and realizing the fundamental rights and social justice embedded in the Indian Constitution
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, judicial review is an indispensable component of India's constitutional democracy, safeguarding rights, enforcing the rule of law, and maintaining the constitutional balance. 
	- While its evolution through doctrines like the Basic Structure and PIL has empowered the judiciary to be a proactive force for social justice, the ongoing debates around judicial overreach highlight the need for **judicial restraint, transparency, and institutional accountability**
