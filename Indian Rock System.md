# Indian Rock System

![[Pasted image 20250725153051.png]]

- Rock System Based on Geological History Of India
	- The Archaean Rock System
		- Rocks formed prior to the Cambrian system.
		- The Archaean rock system includes:
			- Archaean Gneisses and Schists
				- **Oldest rocks** (pre-Cambrian era) (formed about 4 billion years ago)
				- Rocks formed due to solidification of molten magma – the earth’s surface was very hot then
				- Known as the ‘Basement Complex’ 
				- Foliated and thoroughly crystalline
			- Dharwar System
				- Highly metamorphosed sedimentary rock-system. (formed due to metamorphosis of sediments of Archaean gneisses and schists)
				- They are the oldest metamorphosed rocks
				- Found in abundance in the Dharwar district of Karnataka
				- Economically the most important rocks because they possess valuable minerals like high grade iron-ore, manganese, copper, lead, gold, etc.
	- The Purana Rock System (1400 – 600 Million Years)
		- Includes two divisions: the Cuddapah System and the Vindhyan System
			- Cuddapah System
				- Unfossiliferous (without fossils) clay, slates, sandstones and limestones was deposited in synclinal basins (depression between 2 folds)
				- Best observed in Cuddapah district of Andhra Pradesh
				- These rocks contain ores of iron, manganese, copper, cobalt, nickel, etc
			- Vindhyan System
				- This system derives its name from the great Vindhyan mountains
				- The system comprises of ancient sedimentary rocks superimposed on the Archaean base.
				- Large area of this belt is covered by the Deccan trap.
	- The Dravidian Rock System
		- Formed about 600 – 300 million years ago
		- Found in the Extra Peninsular region (Himalayas and Ganga plain) and are very rare in Peninsular India. (The name ‘Dravidian’ doesn’t mean they are found in South India)
		- Abundant fossils.
			- Carboniferous rocks (350 million years)
				- comprise mainly of limestone, shale and quartzite
				- Mount Everest is composed of Upper Carboniferous limestones.
				- Coal formation started in the Carboniferous age.
					- most of the coal found in India is not of Carboniferous period
	- The Aryan Rock System
		- Gondwana System
			- Derives its name **Gonds**, the most primitive people of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
			- The Gondwana system of rocks is a major geological formation in India, known for its significant coal deposits
			- These rocks are primarily sedimentary and are found in areas like the Damodar River valley, Mahanadi River valley, and parts of Madhya Pradesh.
			- Gondwana Coal
				- Gondwana rocks contain nearly 98 per cent of India’s coal reserves.
				- Gondwana coal is much younger than the Carboniferous coal and hence it’s carbon content is low
				- They have rich deposits of iron ore, copper, uranium and antimony also.
		- Jurassic System
			- The marine transgression (sea levels rise) in the latter part of the Jurassic gave rise to thick series of shallow water deposits in Rajasthan and in Kutch.
			- Coral limestone, sandstone, conglomerates and shales occur in Kutch
			- Another transgression on the east coast of the Peninsula is found between Guntur and Rajahmundry
		- Deccan Trap
			- Volcanic outburst over a vast area of the Peninsular India from the end of the Cretaceous till the beginning of the Eocene gave rise to Deccan Traps.
			- Basaltic lava flowed out of fissures covering a vast area of about ten lakh sq. km
			- These volcanic deposits have flat top and steep sides and therefore called ‘trap’ meaning a ‘stair’
			- The process of weathering and erosion (denudation) since millions of years has reduced the Deccan Trap to almost half of its original size
			- Present Deccan Trap covers about 5 lakh sq. km mainly in parts of Kutch, Saurashtra, Maharashtra, the Malwa plateau and northern Karnataka
			- The weathering of these rocks for a long time has given birth to black cotton soil known as ‘regur’.
		- Tertiary System
			- The tertiary is the most significant period in India’s geological history because the Himalayas were born and India’s present form came into being in this period.
