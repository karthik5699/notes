## Questions:

1. The process of desertification does not have climatic boundaries. Justify with examples.

# Desertification

- Introduction
	- It is the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">land degradation</mark> in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas caused by a combination of climatic variations and human activities. 
	- The key is **degradation of productive land into desert-like conditions**, not just the existence of a desert climate.
- Why is it not confined to climatic boundaries?
	- If desertification were purely climatic, we’d only expect it in naturally dry climates. 
	- But in reality, human actions—deforestation, overgrazing, over-irrigation, groundwater depletion, unsustainable agriculture, mining—can strip land of its fertility in _any_ region
- Examples
	- Tropical & Humid Regions
		- _Amazon Basin_: 
			- Large-scale deforestation has reduced forest cover, exposing soil to erosion and nutrient depletion. 
			- Even in a rainforest climate, land patches are turning into barren areas.
		- _Western Ghats, India_: 
			- Shifting cultivation, mining, and deforestation in high-rainfall regions cause soil degradation and loss of fertility.
		- *Indo-Gangetic Basin*
			- Overuse of fertilizers and tube well irrigation has led to salinization and decline in productivity.
	- Semi-arid/Arid Regions
		- _Sahel Region, Africa_: 
			- Overgrazing and population pressure have accelerated desert-like conditions beyond natural aridity.
		- _Rajasthan, India_: 
			- Thar Desert expansion due to over-cultivation, firewood collection, and groundwater overuse.
		- *Aravalli Hills, Rajasthan, Haryana*: 
			- Illegal stone mining led to deforestation, water stress, and sand drift into fertile areas
	- Temperate Regions
		- _Dust Bowl, USA (1930s)_: 
			- In the fertile prairies, excessive ploughing + drought converted large stretches into dust-ridden wastelands.
- Impacts of Desertification
	- Agriculture and livelihood
		- Decrease in soil fertility → Declining yields → Food insecurity, especially in rural India & Sub-Saharan Africa
	- Water resources
		- Loss of vegetation reduces groundwater recharge → Surface runoff increases → Water scarcity
	- Biodiversity loss
		- Degraded habitats cause extinction of flora and fauna
	- Health hazards
		- Dust storms, contaminated water, and malnutrition
	- Migration and conflicts
		- Land degradation often forces rural-urban migration and fuels disputes over dwindling resources
- Global Initiatives to Combat Desertification
	- UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) (1994)
		- The only legally binding global treaty focused on land degradation.
		- Promotes Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN)—restoring as much land as is degraded
	- Bonn Challenge
		- Global effort to restore 350 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.
	- COP16 – Riyadh Declaration (2024)
		- Called for $2.6 trillion in investment for land restoration
	- Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
		- SDG 15.3 aims to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030
- Conclusion
	- A desert need not be born under a desert sun—human missteps can manufacture one even in the lap of rainforests.
