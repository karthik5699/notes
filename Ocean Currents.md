## Questions:

1. Explain the factors responsible for the origin of ocean currents. How do they influence regional climates, fishing and navigation? (2015)

# Ocean Currents

![[Pasted image 20250718180751.png]]
- Ocean Movements
	- The movements that occur in oceans are categorized as: waves, tides and currents
	- Waves are formed due to friction between wind and surface water layer. 
		- The stronger the wind, the bigger the wave. 
		- They die out quickly on reaching the shore or shallow waters.
	- Horizontal currents arise mainly due to friction between wind and water. Rotation of earth, Coriolis force and differences in water level gradient also play a major role
	- Vertical currents arise mainly due to density differences caused by temperature and salinity changes
	- Tsunami, storm surge and tides are tidal waves
- # Ocean currents
	- ![[Pasted image 20250719143131.png]]
	- Ocean currents are the most important ocean movements because of their influence on climatology of various regions
	- Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a **regular** volume of water in a **definite** path and direction
	- Primary Forces Responsible For Ocean Currents
		- Influence of insolation
			- Heating by solar energy causes the water to expand. 
			- That is why, near the equator the ocean water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes
			- This causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope.
		- Influence of wind (atmospheric circulation)
			- Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move. 
			- Friction between the wind and the water surface affects the movement of the water body in its course
			- Winds are responsible for both magnitude and direction (Coriolis force also affects direction) of the ocean currents. 
			- Example: Monsoon winds are responsible for the seasonal reversal of ocean currents in the Indian ocean.
			- The oceanic circulation pattern roughly corresponds to the earth’s atmospheric circulation pattern.
			- The air circulation over the oceans in the middle latitudes is mainly anticyclonic (Sub-tropical High Pressure Belt)
				- The oceanic circulation pattern also corresponds with the same.
			- At higher latitudes, where the wind flow is mostly cyclonic (Sub-polar Low Pressure Belt), the oceanic circulation follows this pattern
		- Influence of gravity
			- Gravity tends to pull the water down to pile and create gradient variation.
		- Influence of Coriolis force
			- The Coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the **right** in the northern hemisphere and to the **left** in the southern hemisphere.
			- These large accumulations of water and the flow around them are called Gyres. 
				- ![[Pasted image 20250718181731.png]]
			- These produce large circular currents in all the ocean basins. 
			- One such circular current is the Sargasso Sea.

	- Secondary Forces Responsible For Ocean Currents
		- Temperature difference and salinity difference are the secondary forces
		- Water with high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in the same way cold water is denser than warm water.
		- Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator.
		- Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface, flowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water.
- Types of Ocean Currents
	- Based on depth
		- The ocean currents may be classified based on their depth as surface currents and deep water currents
	- Based on temperature
		- ![[Pasted image 20250719143015.png]]
		- Cold currents
			- bring cold water into warm water areas (from high latitudes to low latitudes).
			- These currents are usually found on the west coast of the continents (currents flow in clockwise direction in northern hemisphere and in anti-clockwise direction in southern hemisphere) in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres) and on the east coast in the higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
		- Warm currents 
			- bring warm water into cold water areas (low to high latitudes) and are usually observed on the east coast of continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres). 
			- In the northern hemisphere they are found on the west coasts of continents in high latitudes
- General Characteristics of Ocean Currents 
	- The general movement of the currents in the northern hemisphere is clockwise and in the southern hemisphere, anti-clockwise.
		- This is due to the Coriolis force which is a deflective force and follows Ferrel’s law.
		- A notable exception to this trend is seen in the northern part of the Indian Ocean where the current movement changes its direction in response to the seasonal change in the direction of monsoon winds.
	- The warm currents move towards the cold seas and cool currents towards the warm seas.
		- ==In the lower latitudes, the warm currents flow on the eastern shores and cold on the western shores==
		- The situation is reversed in the higher latitudes. The warm currents move along the western shores and the cold currents along the eastern shores.
	- The shape and position of coasts play an important role in guiding the direction of currents.
		- The currents flow not only at the surface but also below the sea surface (due to salinity and temperature difference).
		- For instance, heavy surface water of the Mediterranean Sea sinks and flows westward past Gibraltar as a sub-surface current
- Effects of Ocean Currents
	- Desert formation
		- Cold ocean currents have a direct effect on desert formation in west coast regions of the tropical and subtropical continents.
		- There is fog and most of the areas are arid due to desiccating effect (loss of moisture).
	- Rains
		- Warm ocean currents bring rain to coastal areas and even interiors. Example: Summer Rainfall in British Type climate.
		- Warm currents flow parallel to the east coasts of the continents in tropical and subtropical latitudes. This results in warm and rainy climates. 
	- Moderating effect
		- They are responsible for moderate temperatures at coasts. 
			- North Atlantic Drift brings warmness to England. 
			- Canary cold current brings cooling effect to Spain, Portugal etc.
	- Fishing
		- Mixing of cold and warm ocean currents bear richest fishing grounds in the world.
		- Example: Grand Banks around Newfoundland, Canada and North-Eastern Coast of Japan
	- Tropical cyclones
		- They pile up warm waters in tropics and this warm water is the major force behind tropical cyclones.
	- Navigation
		- Currents are referred to by their “drift”. 
		- Usually, the currents are strongest near the surface and may attain speeds over five knots
		- Ships usually follow routes which are aided by ocean currents and winds




## Personal Analysis:

Density differences in ocean water contribute to a global-scale circulation system, also called the global conveyor belt. The global conveyor belt includes both surface and deep ocean currents that circulate the globe in a 1,000-year cycle.
