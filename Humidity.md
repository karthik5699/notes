- Water Cycle – Hydrological cycle
	- ![[Pasted image 20250709145737.png]]
	- There is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation
	- The moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration (evapotranspiration = evaporation + transpiration)
	- Evaporated water undergoes condensation and forms clouds.
	- When saturation is reached, clouds give away water in the form of precipitation
	- Since the total amount of moisture in the entire system remains constant, a balance is required between evapotranspiration and precipitation. The hydrological cycle maintains this balance.
- Water Vapour in Atmosphere
	- Water vapour in air varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere (averaging around 2% in the atmosphere).
	- Significance of Atmospheric Moisture
		- Water vapour absorbs radiation—both incoming and terrestrial. It thus plays a crucial role in the earth’s heat budget
		- The amount of water vapour present decides the quantity of latent energy stored up in the atmosphere for development of storms and cyclones.
		- The atmospheric moisture affects the human body’s rate of cooling by influencing the sensible temperature
	- Evaporation
		- The oceans covering 71% of the earth’s surface hold 97% of all the earth’s water reserves
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Evapotranspiration may be taken as the starting point in the hydrological cycle. The oceans contribute 84% of the annual total and the continents 16%</mark>
		- The highest annual evaporation occur in the sub-tropics of the western North Atlantic and North Pacific because of the influence of the Gulf Stream and the Kurishino Current (warm ocean currents), and in the trade wind zone of the southern oceans.
		- The land maximum occurs in equatorial region because of high insolation
- Humidity
	- Water vapour present in the air is known as Humidity
	- Absolute Humidity
		- The actual amount of the water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as the absolute humidity
		- It is the weight of water vapour per unit volume of air and is expressed in terms of grams per cubic metre.
		- The absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth
		- The ability of the air to hold water vapour depends entirely on its temperature (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air</mark>).
	- Relative Humidity
		- The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity.
		- Relative humidity is greater over the oceans and least over the continents (absolute humidity is greater over oceans because of greater availability of water for evaporation)
		- The relative humidity determines the amount and rate of evaporation and hence it is an important climatic factor
		- Air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be ‘saturated’. At this temperature, the air cannot hold any additional amount of moisture. Thus, relative humidity of the saturated air is 100%.
		- Dew point
			- The air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated.
			- The temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point.
			- Dew point occurs when Relative Humidity = 100%.
	- Specific Humidity
		- It is expressed as the weight of water vapour per unit weight of air.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250709152358.png]]
		- Specific humidity is not affected by changes in pressure or temperature.
