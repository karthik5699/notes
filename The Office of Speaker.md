		- The Speaker has the final power to maintain order within the House and interpret its Rules of Procedure
	- The Speaker acts as a mediator between the government and the opposition
	- Legislative Functions: 
		- The Speaker rules on the validity and placing of various parliamentary instruments such as calling attention notices, special mentions, motions of parliamentary privilege and questions to ministers. 
		- The Speaker also presides over joint sittings of the two Houses
	- Adjudicator on Money Bills: 
		- A crucial power of the Speaker is to decide whether a Bill is a Money Bill.

- Election and Impartiality
	- The Speaker of the Lok Sabha is elected by the House from among its members
	- In India, the Speaker is usually from the ruling party or coalition, which can lead to perceptions of bias. 
	- This contrasts with the British Parliament where the Speaker resigns from their political party upon election and contests re-election without a party ticket, and major parties do not nominate opposing candidates
	- The Speaker of Lok Sabha represents the dignity and authority of the house, and therefore political neutrality is expected from the office
	- The Speaker's decisions, particularly on Money Bills and no-confidence motions, have come under scrutiny. 
	- There have been instances where Speakers have been accused of complicity with the ruling party or delaying decisions on disqualification petitions
- Conclusion
