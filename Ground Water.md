# Ground Water

- Introduction
	- Ground water is the water stored beneath the surface of the Earth in aquifers.
	- India is the largest user of groundwater and has the largest area under groundwater irrigation in the world.
	- Over 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water depend on ground water. 
- Key Factors affecting ground water levels
	- Natural factors:
		- Precipitation -> more precipitation more ground water recharge
		- Type of land -> decides the amount of percolation and runoff
		- Structure of rocks -> permeability and porosity of rock
		- Vegetation -> plants reduce runoff, promote infiltration, and stabilize soil
	- Anthropogenic factors
		- Over-extraction for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes depletes aquifers faster than recharge rates
		- Urbanization: Impervious surfaces (concrete, asphalt) reduce infiltration and increase runoff, hindering recharge.
		- Deforestation: Removes natural cover, leading to increased runoff and soil erosion, reducing recharge
		- Water-intensive crops and inefficient irrigation (flood irrigation) lead to high groundwater consumption
- Key Factors behind Groundwater Pollution
	- Major contaminants of ground water are:
		- Nitrate (e.g., Rajasthan)
		- Fluoride (e.g., Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana)
		- Arsenic (e.g., West Bengal, Punjab, Bihar)
		- Uranium (e.g., Rajasthan, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh)
		- Salinity (e.g., Delhi)
	- Harmful Agricultural Practices
		- Excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture
	- Industrial Pollution
		- Untreated industrial waste and heavy metals discharge
	- Urbanisation
		- Sewage leaks and landfill runoff
	- Climate Change: 
		- Altered rainfall patterns and overuse hinder aquifer replenishment, worsening water quality.
- Groundwater Stress in India
	- Distribution
		- The crisis is most acute in North and Central India, particularly Punjab and Haryana
		- Due to water-intensive crops (rice, wheat, sugarcane), extensive tubewell use, and heavily subsidized/free electricity for pumps
		- The upper Ganga-Yamuna doab and the surrounding areas of western Uttar Pradesh also practice water-intensive agriculture and experience groundwater stress
		- Maharashtra, despite lower overall over-exploitation, has severe stress in Marathwada and the "sugar belt."
		- Tamil Nadu heavily relies on groundwater, with falling levels despite monsoon rains and early adoption of rainwater harvesting.
		- Rapid urbanization in cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, and western Rajasthan has exacerbated groundwater depletion
			- Many cities depend solely on groundwater, leading to over-extraction, deeper borewells
			- NITI Aayog predicts 21 cities could exhaust groundwater by 2030
	- Causes of Depletion
		- The Green Revolution encouraged water-intensive crops like rice and wheat, which are unsuitable for many regions.
		- Government policies, including subsidized electricity for agriculture and procurement of water-intensive crops at Minimum Support Price (MSP), disincentivize water conservation
		- The 'Tragedy of the Commons' dynamic, where individual farmers over-pump.
	- Consequences
		- Groundwater depletion leads to 
			- increased pumping costs
			- debt for smallholders
			- poor water quality (fluoride, arsenic, heavy metals)
			- reduced crop yields
			- land subsidence
			- potential socio-economic distress and migration
	- Mitigation Efforts
		- Promotion of Water-Efficient Crops
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Atal Bhujal Yojana</mark>: Community-led groundwater management
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Jal Shakti Abhiyan</mark>: Promotes rainwater harvesting
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana</mark>: micro-irrigation subsidies, crop diversification incentives
		- CGWB aquifer mapping
- Conclusion
	- This crisis presents a nexus between agriculture, environmental sustainability and governance.
