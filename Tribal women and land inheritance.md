## Questions:

1. What are the challenges faced by tribal women in inheriting ancestral property and how can the codification of tribal laws, similar to those for Hindus and Christians, address these challenges?

# Tribal women and land inheritance

- Introduction
	- Tribal women face several challenges in inheriting ancestral property, which are deeply rooted in customary laws and social practices within tribal communities
- Key challenges:
	- Gender Disparity in Inheritance: 
		- Tribal customary laws often exclude women from land inheritance despite their significant contribution to agriculture and community life.
	- Fear of Land Alienation: 
		- Concerns about land alienation due to inter-tribal marriages often curtail women's inheritance rights.
	- Communitarian Land Ownership: 
		- Tribal lands are communitarian, but proceeds from land sales are rarely distributed to village councils or women
	- Legal Exclusion: 
		- The Hindu Succession Act, 2005 excludes tribal women, leaving a legal vacuum regarding their property rights
	- Customary Law Recognition: 
		- Courts require customs to meet criteria such as antiquity, reasonableness, and morality to be recognized as binding law, but many discriminatory customs persist.
- How Codification of Tribal Laws Can Address These Challenges
	- Legal Clarity and Uniformity: 
		- Codification would provide clear, written laws that protect tribal women's inheritance rights, reducing ambiguity and discriminatory practices based on oral customs.
	- Gender Equality: 
		- A codified Tribal Succession Act can explicitly include provisions to ensure gender parity, aligning with Article 14 of the Indian Constitution
	- Empowerment and Awareness: 
		- Written laws can facilitate better awareness among tribal communities and authorities, promoting enforcement and reducing conflicts.
	- Integration with National Policies: 
		- Codified laws can be harmonized with broader tribal welfare policies and schemes, ensuring comprehensive protection and development.
- Conclusion
	- In conclusion, codifying tribal succession laws is a crucial step towards securing property rights for tribal women, promoting gender justice, and aligning tribal customs with constitutional principles.
