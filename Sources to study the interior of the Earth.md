## Questions:



# Interior of the Earth

- Direct Sources of information about the Earth’s Interior
	- Deep earth mining and drilling reveal the nature of rocks deep down the surface
	- But as mining and drilling are not practically possible beyond a certain depth, they don’t reveal much information about the earth’s interior.
	- Volcanic eruption forms another source of obtaining direct information
- Indirect Sources of information about the Earth’s Interior
	- Increase in pressure and temperature with depth
		- Sources of Earth's heat:
			- Radioactive decay
			- Primordial heat
			- Tidal friction
	- Seismic waves
		- most important source available to understand the layered structure of the earth
	- Meteorites
		- Meteorites and Earth are born from the same nebular cloud. Thus, they are likely to have a similar internal structure
	- Gravitation
		- The gravitation force differs according to the mass of material. The uneven distribution of mass of material within the earth influences this value. Such a difference is called gravity anomaly
		- Gravity anomalies give us information about the **distribution of mass** in the crust of the earth
	- Magnetic field
		- The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the dynamo effect in the liquid outer core
