1. Bring out the constructive programmes of Mahatma Gandhi during Non-Cooperation Movement and Civil Disobedience Movement

# Constructive Programs of Mahatma Gandhi

Mahatma Gandhi's constructive programs were an integral part of his broader strategy during both the Non-Cooperation Movement (NCM) and the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), especially during the passive phase or "truce phases"(remember Struggle-Truce-Struggle?). 

Tilak Swaraj Fund was established in 1920 by the Indian National Congress to fund **constructive programmes** aimed at achieving _Swaraj (self-rule)_ within one year.

Key aspects of the constructive programs included:
- Popularisation of Khadi and Hand-Spinning
	- This involved encouraging the use of home-spun cloth to promote self-reliance and boycott foreign goods
- National Education
	- Thousands of students left government schools and colleges to join national schools and colleges that sprang up across the country
	- These institutions were organized under leaders like Acharya Narendra Dev, C.R. Das, Lala Lajpat Rai, Zakir Hussain, and Subhash Bose, and included Jamia Millia, Kashi Vidyapeeth
- Hindu-Muslim Unity 
	- Participants were urged to work for Hindu-Muslim unity, reflecting Gandhi's vision of collective action against colonial rule
- Removal of Untouchability & Harijan Campaign
	- This was a crucial social reform aspect, with emphasis on the upliftment of the Harijans
	- He undertook a comprehensive Harijan tour (1932) from covering over 20,000 km, raising funds for the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Harijan Sevak Sangh</mark>, and propagating the removal of untouchability in all its forms
	- He advocated for temple entry for untouchables, stressing humanism and reason over tradition
	- He emphasized that untouchability had no sanction in the Hindu Shastras, and if it did, such scriptures should be ignored as they went against human dignity
	- His campaign also promoted internal reforms among Harijans, including education, cleanliness, hygiene, giving up beef and carrion, and alcohol consumption
	- Gradually, the campaign carried the message of nationalism to Harijans who also happened to be the agricultural labourers in most parts of the country, leading to their increasing participation in the national and peasant movements.
- Boycott of Liquor 
	- Campaigning against liquor was another important element, leading to picketing of toddy shops and a significant decline in government revenues
- Establishment of Panchayats 
	- These were encouraged for the dispensation of justice, providing an alternative to the colonial legal system
- Grassroots Organization 
	- Ashrams were established across the country, serving as centres for training political cadres in khadi work and social service among lower castes and tribal populations. 
	- This helped build bonds with masses previously untouched by politics, developing their organizing capacity and self-reliance


In summary, these constructive programs allowed the Congress to build a strong base among diverse sections of the population, including peasants, workers, women, and lower castes, who were previously untouched by mainstream politics. They kept political work and volunteer training going even during the passive phases, helping avoid loss of morale and keeping the movement organised.
