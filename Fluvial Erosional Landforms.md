# Fluvial Erosional Landforms

The landforms created as a result of degradational action (erosion and transportation) or aggradational work (deposition) of running water are called fluvial landforms.

Fluvial Erosional Landforms
- Landforms created by the erosional activity of rivers
- Various aspects of fluvial erosive action:
	- Hydration
		- the force of running water wearing down rocks.
	- Corrosion
		- chemical action that leads to weathering.
	- Attrition
		- river load particles striking, colliding against each other and breaking down in the process.
	- Corrasion or abrasion
		- solid river load striking against rocks and wearing them down.
	- Downcutting (vertical erosion) 
		- the erosion of the base of a stream (downcutting leads to valley deepening)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250701170408.png]]
	- Lateral erosion 
		- the erosion of the walls of a stream (leads to valley widening)
	- Headward erosion
		- erosion at the origin of a stream channel, which causes the origin to move back away from the direction of the stream flow
	- Braiding 
		- the main water channel splitting into multiple, narrower channel
		- ![[Pasted image 20250702143545.png]]
		- Braided streams occur in rivers with large sediment load
- #### River Valley Formation
	- A river valley is a landform, typically V-shaped, carved by the erosional action of a flowing river or stream over geological time. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702161743.png]]
	- It starts with the initial downward cutting of a river into the landscape (vertical erosion)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702144645.png]]
	- A deep and narrow ‘V’ shaped valley is also referred to as **gorge** and may result due to downcutting erosion
	- Most Himalayan rivers pass through deep gorges before they descend to the plains.
	- An extended form of the gorge is called a **canyon.** 
		- The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River in Arizona (USA)
- #### River Course
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702145359.png]]
	- Youth
		- Young rivers (A) close to their source tend to be fast-flowing, high-energy environments with rapid headward erosion
		- Steep-sided “V-shaped’ valleys, waterfalls, and rapids are characteristic features
		- E.g. Rivers flowing in the Himalayas
	- Maturity
		- Mature rivers (B) are lower-energy systems
		- Erosion takes place on the outside of bends, creating looping meanders in the soft alluvium of the river plain
		- E.g. Rivers flowing in the Indo-Gangetic-Brahmaputra plain
	- Old Age
		- At a river’s mouth (C), sediment is deposited as the velocity of the river slows
		- As the river becomes shallower more deposition occurs, forming temporary islands (Majuli, a river island in the Brahmaputra River, Assam is currently the world’s largest river island) and braiding (e.g. braided channels of Brahmaputra river flood plain in Assam)
		- As the sediment is laid down, the actual mouth of the river moves away from the source into the sea or lake, forming a **delta**.
			- Delta = A depositional landform at the mouth of a river where it enters a larger body of water.
		- E.g. Ganga-Brahmaputra delta.

- ##### Waterfalls
	- fall of an enormous volume of water from a great height.
	- mostly seen in the youth stage of the river
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702150715.png]]
	- **Kunchikal Falls** (it is a cascade falls ― falls with many steps) formed by Varahi river in Karnataka is the highest waterfall in India
		- ![[Pasted image 20250702151757.png]]
	- Nohkalikai Falls (340 m) is the tallest plunge waterfall in India. The waterfall is located near Cherrapunji.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250702151825.png]]
	- Jog or Gersoppa falls (253 m) on Sharavati river (a tributary of Cauvery), Karnataka is the second-highest plunge waterfall in India
		- ![[Pasted image 20250702151921.png]]
	- **Angel Falls** in Venezuela is the world’s highest waterfall, with a height of 979 metres and a plunge of 807 metres.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250702152029.png]]
- ##### Meanders
	- a pronounced curve or loop in the course of a river channel.
	- The meanders may be wavy, horse-shoe type or oxbow type
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702152303.png]]
- Oxbow lake
	- Sometimes, because of intensive erosion action, the outer curve of a meander gets accentuated to such an extent that the inner ends of the loop come close enough to get disconnected from the main channel and exist as independent water bodies called as oxbow lakes.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702152717.png]]
	- Can be found in the Indo-Gangetic plains
- #### Drainage Basin
	- Other terms that are used to describe drainage basins are **catchment, catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, and water basin**
	- The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers and the land surface
	- The drainage basin acts as a funnel by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702154758.png]]
	- River Basin vs Watershed
		- In a river basin, all the water drains to a large river. The term watershed is used to describe a smaller area of land that drains to a smaller stream, lake or wetland
		- Example: watershed of Yamuna + watershed of Chambal + watershed of Gandak + …. = Drainage basin of Ganga.
	- Amazon River has the largest river basin




## Personal Analysis:

River basin is a subset of a drainage basin.
