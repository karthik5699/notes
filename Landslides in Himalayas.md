## Questions:

1. “The Himalayas are highly prone to landslides.” Discuss the causes and suggest suitable measures of mitigation.

# Landslides in Himalayas

- Introduction
	- A landslide is a mass movement of material, such as rock, earth or debris, down a slope. 
	- The Himalayas, being the youngest and tectonically most active fold mountains of the world, are highly vulnerable to landslides
- Why the Himalayas are prone to landslides
	- Geological youth and instability
		- The Himalayas are the youngest fold mountains, still rising due to active tectonics
	- Steep topography
		- Rapid uplift leads to steep slopes, so gravity has more pull.
		- River incision (deep cutting of valleys) further steepens slopes, priming them for collapse
	- Seismicity
		- The Himalayas lie in a seismically active zone. 
		- Earthquakes shake and weaken slope materials, creating conditions for sudden slides.
	- Intense monsoon rains
		- Heavy rainfall saturates soil, increasing weight and reducing friction.
		- Cloudbursts and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) act as sudden triggers.
	- Human interventions
		- Road cutting, hydropower projects, tunneling, unscientific construction, and deforestation disturb slope equilibrium.
- Measures for Mitigation
	- Engineering and structural measures
		- **Slope stabilization**: retaining walls, rock bolting, terracing
		- **Proper drainage**: surface and sub-surface drains to reduce water infiltration
		- **Scientific road alignment**: avoiding over-cutting and stabilizing vulnerable stretches
	- Ecological measures
		- **Afforestation** with species that bind soil.
		- **Ban on quarrying and deforestation** in vulnerable areas
		- Zonation mapping: restricting construction in high-hazard zones
	- Planning and policy measures
		- **Early warning systems** using remote sensing, rainfall thresholds, and real-time monitoring
		- **Land use planning**: no heavy structures on unstable slopes.
		- **Community preparedness**: training locals in evacuation and response
- Conclusion
	- Landslides in the Himalayas are a product of both natural fragility and human negligence. 
	- While they cannot be eliminated, their impacts can be minimized through scientific planning, eco-sensitive development, and community resilience.
