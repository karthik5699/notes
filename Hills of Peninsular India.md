# Hills of Peninsular India

![[Pasted image 20250729153817.png]]

- Introduction
	- The plateaus of the Peninsular region are separated from one another by these hill ranges and various river valleys.
- Aravali Range
	- They are aligned in north-east to south-west direction.
	- They run for about 800 km between Delhi and Gujarat
	- They are one of the oldest (very old) fold mountains of the world and the oldest in India. 
	- The range is conspicuous in Rajasthan but becomes less distinct in Haryana and Delhi 
	- Here Mt. Abu (1,158 m), a small hilly block, is separated from the main range by the valley of the Banas. 
	- Guru Sikhar (1,722 m), the highest peak, is situated in Mt. Abu.
- Vindhyan Range
	- It runs more or less parallel to the Narmada Valley in an east-west direction
	- This range acts as <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">a watershed between the Ganga system and the river systems of south India</mark>
	- The rivers Chambal, Betwa and Ken rise within 30 km of the Narmada
- Satpura Range
	- Satpura range is a series of seven mountains
	- It runs in an east-west direction south of the Vindhyas and in between the Narmada and the Tapi, roughly parallel to these rivers
	- Amarkantak (1,127 m) is another important peak.
- Western Ghats
	- ![[Pasted image 20250729155340.png]]
	- The Western Ghats are steep-sided, terraced, flat-topped hills presenting a stepped topography facing the Arabian Sea coast.
	- The Western Ghats abruptly rise as a sheer wall to an average elevation of 1,000 m from the Western Coastal Plain.
	- But they slope gently on their eastern flank and hardly appear to be a mountain when viewed from the Deccan tableland.
	- There is no formation of deltas by rivers of the Western Ghats. Why?
		- The Western Ghats have a steep gradient, meaning the rivers descend rapidly towards the sea. This high velocity doesn't allow them to deposit much sediment for long distances.
		- The distance from the source to the sea is relatively short, further limiting the riversâ€™ ability for sediment accumulation.
- Eastern Ghats
	- Eastern Ghats run almost parallel to the east coast of India leaving broad plains between their base and the coast.
	- It is a chain of highly broken and detached hills starting from the Mahanadi in Odisha to the Vagai in Tamil Nadu. 
	- They almost disappear between the Godavari and the Krishna (where instead Gondwana formations are seen)
	- They neither have structural unity nor physiographic continuity. Therefore these hill groups are generally treated as independent units
	- Further south, the Eastern Ghats merge with the Western Ghats.
		- Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve is a crucial ecological corridor connecting the two mountain ranges.
- Significance of the Peninsular Plateau
	- There are huge deposits of iron, manganese, copper, bauxite, chromium, mica, gold, etc
	- 98% of the Gondwana coal deposits of India are found in the Peninsular Plateau
	- Some hilly regions in south India are suitable for the cultivation of plantation crops like tea, coffee, rubber, etc.
	- The plateau is also known for its hill resorts such as Udagamangalam (Ooty), Panchmarhi, Kodaikanal, Mahabaleshwar, Khandala, Matheron, Mount Abu, etc
