# El Nino and La Nina

- Introduction
	- El Niño is the name given to the occasional development of warm ocean surface waters along the coast of Ecuador and Peru.
	- When this warming occurs the usual upwelling of cold, nutrient rich deep ocean water is significantly reduced
	- El Niño normally occurs around Christmas and usually lasts for a few weeks to a few months
- Normal Conditions
	- In a normal year, a surface low pressure develops in the region of northern Australia and Indonesia and a high pressure system over the coast of Peru. As a result, the trade winds over the Pacific Ocean move strongly from east to west.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715141638.png]]
	- The easterly flow of the trade winds carries warm surface waters westward, bringing convective storms (thunderstorms) to Indonesia and coastal Australia. 
	- Along the coast of Peru, cold bottom cold nutrient rich water wells up to the surface to replace the warm water that is pulled to the west
- Walker circulation (Occurs during Normal Years)
	- The Walker circulation (walker cell) is caused by the pressure gradient force that results from a high pressure system over the eastern Pacific ocean, and a low pressure system over Indonesia.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715141827.png]]
	- The Walker cell is indirectly related to upwelling off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador. This brings nutrient-rich cold water to the surface, increasing fishing stocks.
- During El Nino year
	- In an El Niño year, air pressure drops over large areas of the central Pacific and along the coast of South America
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715142058.png]]
	- The normal low pressure system is replaced by a weak high in the western Pacific (the southern oscillation). This change in pressure pattern causes the trade winds to be reduced == Weak Walker Cell. Sometimes Walker Cell might even get reversed.
	- This reduction allows the equatorial counter current (current along doldrums) to accumulate warm ocean water along the coastlines of Peru and Ecuador
	- This accumulation of warm water causes the thermocline to drop in the eastern part of Pacific Ocean which cuts off the upwelling of cold deep ocean water along the coast of Peru
	- Climatically, the development of an El Niño brings drought to the western Pacific, rains to the equatorial coast of South America, and convective storms and hurricanes to the central Pacific.
- Effects of El Nino
	- The warmer waters had a devastating effect on marine life existing off the coast of Peru and Ecuador.
	- Fish catches off the coast of South America were lower than in the normal year (Because there is no upwelling).
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715142540.png]]
	- Severe droughts occur in Australia, Indonesia, India and southern Africa. 
	- Heavy rains in California, Ecuador, and the Gulf of Mexico
- How El Nino impacts monsoon rainfall in India
	- El Nino and Indian monsoon are inversely related
	- The most prominent droughts in India – six of them – since 1871 have been El Nino droughts, including the recent ones in 2002 and 2009
	- However, not all El Nino years led to a drought in India. 
	- El Nino directly impacts India’s agrarian economy as it tends to lower the production of summer crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton and oilseeds
- El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
	- The formation of an El Niño (Circulation of Water) is linked with Pacific Ocean circulation pattern known as the southern oscillation (circulation of atmospheric pressure)
	- Southern Oscillation, in oceanography and climatology, is a coherent inter-annual fluctuation of atmospheric pressure over the tropical Indo-Pacific region.
	- El Nino and Southern Oscillation coincide most of the times hence their combination is called ENSO – El Nino Southern Oscillation
	- Only El Nino == (Warm water in Eastern Pacific + Cold water in Western Pacific)
	- Only SO == (Low Pressure over Eastern Pacific + High Pressure over Western Pacific)
	- ENSO = (Warm water in Eastern Pacific + Low Pressure over Eastern Pacific) + (Cold water in Western Pacific + High Pressure over Western Pacific)
- Indian Ocean Dipole effect (Not every El Nino year is same in India)
	- Although ENSO was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in the recent decades the ENSO-Monsoon relationship seemed to weaken in the Indian subcontinent. For e.g. the 1997, strong ENSO failed to cause drought in India.
	- However, it was later discovered that just like ENSO was an event in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the Indian Ocean was also at play. It was discovered in 1999 and named the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). 
	- The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between two areas (or poles, hence a dipole) – a western pole in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean) and an eastern pole in the eastern Indian Ocean south of Indonesia
	- ![[Pasted image 20250715143535.png]]
	- IOD develops in the equatorial region of Indian Ocean from April to May peaking in October.
	- With a positive IOD winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west (from Bay of Bengal towards Arabian Sea). This results in the Arabian Sea (western Indian Ocean near African Coast) being much warmer and eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia becoming colder and dry.
	- In the negative dipole year (**negative IOD**), reverse happens making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.
	- It was demonstrated that a positive IOD index often negated the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased Monsoon rains in several ENSO years
	- Similar to ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and named as Equatorial Indian Ocean Oscillation (EQUINOO)(Oscillation of warm water and atmospheric pressure between Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea).
- La Nina
	- After an El Niño event weather conditions usually return back to normal.
	- However, in some years the trade winds can become extremely strong and an abnormal accumulation of cold water can occur in the central and eastern Pacific. This event is called a La Niña.
	- A strong La Niña occurred in 1988 and scientists believe that it may have been responsible for the summer drought over central North America. During this period, the Atlantic Ocean has seen very active hurricane seasons
- Effects of La Nina
	- abnormally heavy monsoons in India and Southeast Asia
	- cool and wet winter weather in southeastern Africa, wet weather in eastern Australia
	- cold winter in western Canada and northwestern United States
