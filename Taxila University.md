## Questions:

1. Taxila university was one of the oldest universities of the world with which were associated a number of renowned learned personalities of different disciplines. Its strategic location caused its fame to flourish, but unlike Nalanda, it is not considered as a university in the modern sense. Discuss.

# Taxila University

Taxila, dating back to at least 6th century BCE is considered among the world's earliest centres of learning. It attracted students from across the Indian subcontinent and beyond. However, unlike _Nalanda_, it lacked several institutional features of a _modern university_, which is why it is not equated with a university in the contemporary sense.

1. Renowned personalities associated with Taxila
	- Panini – The Sanskrit grammarian who authored Ashtadhyayi
	- Kautilya (Chanakya) – Teacher of Chandragupta Maurya and author of Arthashastra
	- Jivaka – Renowned physician of Buddha’s time
	- Charaka – Early contributor to Ayurveda
2. Multidisciplinary Learning
	- Subjects ranged from grammar, medicine, and philosophy to archery, military science, and politics
	- followed the guru-shishya tradition, with students learning under individual masters
3. Strategic Location
	- Situated at the confluence of trade routes (in modern-day Pakistan), especially the Uttarapatha, connecting Central Asia to eastern India
	- It facilitated cross-cultural exchange, especially Indo-Greek and Central Asian influences,
4. Limitations as a 'University' in the modern sense
	- No centralised campus or infrastructure: Education was conducted in private homes or monasteries
	- No centralised curriculum or formal degrees: Learning was informal and varied by teacher
	- Unlike Nalanda, which had a residential structure and royal patronage, Taxila was less institutionalised
5. Comparison with Nalanda
	- Nalanda (5th century CE onwards) had organized administration, monastic affiliations, a structured curriculum, libraries, and international student intake, aligning more closely with modern universities
	- It received patronage from the Gupta rulers and had sustained existence for centuries


While Taxila was a pioneering centre of learning that nurtured many intellectual luminaries, its decentralised and informal nature disqualifies it from being labelled a university in the modern sense.
