# Vesara School of Temple Architecture

Introduction: The Vesara school of temple architecture represents a harmonious blend of the northern Nagara and southern Dravida styles, emerging prominently in the Deccan region between the 7th and 13th centuries CE. This hybrid style flourished under the patronage of dynasties such as the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, and Kakatiyas

Also known as Karnataka school of Architecture. It was conceptualised under the later Chalukya rulers. 

1. Temples of Western Chalukyas
	- created by piling large blocks of stones
	- interiors of mandapas are carved with rich ceiling panels
	- the Chalukyan pillars are square and heavy without a base
	- sculptural decoration plays a much greater role
	- eg: Meguti temple at Aihole, Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal

2. Rashtrakutas
	- built rock-cut temples and shrines in Ajanta, Ellora and Aurangabad
		- Kailasha temple at Ellora: largest rock-cut monument in India and marks the culmination of rock architecture in South Asia

3. Temples of Hoysalas
	- Hoysalas ruled over the Mysore plateau in the 12th and 13th centuries
	- multiple shrines were built around central pillared hall
	- unlike the panchayatan style, the plan of temple starts looking like a star (stellate plan)
	- use of soft stone as building material
	- temples were built on an upraised platform known as Jagati, which was about 1m high
