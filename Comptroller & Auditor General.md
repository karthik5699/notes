## Questions:

1. Exercise of CAG’s powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and the States is derived from Article 149 of the Indian Constitution. Discuss whether audit of the Government’s Policy implementation could amount to overstepping its own (CAG) jurisdiction.

# Comptroller & Auditor General

- Introduction
	- The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, empowered by **Article 149** and the **CAG’s (Duties, Powers & Controls) Act, 1971**, serves as the guardian of the public purse
	- While its primary role is financial and compliance auditing, the debate intensifies when its performance audits scrutinize policy implementation
- Responsibilities
	- The traditional view posits that the CAG's mandate is restricted to ensuring that expenditure is legally sanctioned and conforms to rules. 
	- Proponents of this view, often within the executive, argue that the CAG cannot question the _wisdom_ of a policy itself, as policy formulation is the sovereign domain of the legislature and executive
	- However, the modern conception of accountability necessitates a broader role. 
	- The CAG’s evolution towards **Performance Auditing** evaluates the **'3 Es'—Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness**—of government schemes. 
	- This is not an audit of the policy’s objectives but of its execution. 
	- For instance, in the **2G spectrum and coal block allocation reports**, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">former CAG Vinod Rai</mark> clarified that the audit questioned the _procedure_ of implementation, which led to presumptive losses, not the policy of allocation itself.
- Conclusion
	- Critically, while the CAG must not enter the realm of policy prescription, its role in auditing implementation is a legitimate and vital check on the executive. 
	- It ensures that the translation of policy into practice is efficient and devoid of wastage.
	- Thus, auditing policy implementation is not an overstep but an essential evolution of the CAG's constitutional duty. 
	- The challenge lies in maintaining the delicate balance between ensuring executive accountability and respecting the separation of powers.




## Personal Analysis:

Its performance audits are vital inputs for bodies like the **Public Accounts Committee (PAC)** to ensure executive accountability.
