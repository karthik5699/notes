# Ocean Relief

![[Pasted image 20250718152614.png]]

- Introduction
	- Ocean relief is largely due to tectonic, volcanic, erosional and depositional processes and their interactions
	- Ocean relief features are divided into major and minor relief features
- Major Ocean Relief Features

	- Continental Shelf
		- Continental Shelf is the gently sloping seaward extension of continental plate
		- These extended margins of each continent are occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs
		- The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope, called the shelf break
		- The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers etc.
		- Massive sedimentary deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves, become the source of fossil fuels
		- The average width of continental shelves is between 70 – 80 km
		- The **Siberian shelf** in the Arctic Ocean, the largest in the world, stretches to 1,500 km in width
		- Importance of continent shelves
			- Marine food comes almost entirely from continental shelves
			- They provide the <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">richest fishing grounds</mark>
			- They are potential sites for economic minerals
	- Continental Slope
		- The continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins
		- The gradient of the slope region varies between 2-5°
		- The continental slope boundary indicates the end of the continents
		- Canyons and trenches are observed in this region
	- Continental Rise
		- The continental slope gradually loses its steepness with depth.
		- When the slope reaches a level of between 0.5° and 1°, it is referred to as the continental rise
		- With increasing depth the rise becomes virtually flat and merges with the abyssal plain
	- Deep Sea Plain or Abyssal Plain
		- Deep sea planes are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins
		- These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world
		- It covers nearly 40% of the ocean floor
- Minor Ocean Relief Features
	- Oceanic Deeps or Trenches
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718154620.png]]
		- These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans.
		- They are of tectonic origin and are formed during ocean – ocean convergence and ocean-continent convergence
		- The trenches lie along the fringes of the deep-sea plain at the bases of continental slopes and along island arcs
		- The trenches run parallel to the bordering fold mountains or the island chains.
		- The Mariana Trench off the Guam Islands in the Pacific Ocean is the deepest trench
		- They are associated with active volcanoes and strong earthquakes
	- Mid-Oceanic Ridges or Submarine Ridges
		- A mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression. (Divergent Boundary)
		- The mountain ranges can have peaks as high as 2,500 m and some even reach above the ocean’s surface
		- Running for a total length of 75,000 km, these ridges form the largest mountain systems on earth
		- Iceland, a part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, is an example
	- Abyssal Hills
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718155254.png]]
		- Seamount: It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean
		- Guyots: The flat topped mountains (seamounts) are known as guyots
	- Submarine Canyons
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718155416.png]]
		- CANYON: a deep gorge, especially one with a river flowing through it
		- GORGE: a steep, narrow valley or ravine
		- VALLEY: a low area between hills or mountains or a depression, typically with a river or stream flowing through it.
		- The Hudson Canyon is the best known canyon in the world
	- Atoll
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718160249.png]]
		- These are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression.
	- Reef
		- ![[Pasted image 20250718160512.png]]
		- A reef is a predominantly organic deposit made by living or dead organisms that forms a mound or rocky elevation like a ridge
		- Coral reefs are a characteristic feature of the Pacific Ocean where they are associated with seamounts and guyots
		- The largest reef in the world is found off the Queensland coast of Australia
		- Since the reefs may extend above the surface, they are generally dangerous for navigation
