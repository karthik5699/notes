# Women's organisations in pre-Independent India

From the late 19th and early 20th centuries, women began forming their own organizations, signalling a shift towards self-led efforts for emancipation:

- Bharat Stree Mahamandal (1910):
	- Founded by Sarla Devi Chaudhurani, it aimed to promote education for women, abolish the purdah system, and improve women's socio-economic and political status across India
- Arya Mahila Samaj:
	- Founded by Pandita Ramabai Saraswati
	- She pleaded for improvement in the educational syllabus of Indian women before the English Education Commission which was referred to Queen Victoria. 
		- This resulted in medical education for women
- National Council of Women in India (1925)
	- A national branch of the International Council of Women, formed with the vital role of Mehribai Tata
	- It aimed for a society based on social justice, integrity, and equal rights and opportunities for all
- All India Women's Conference (1927): 
	- Founded by Margaret Cousins, it had an egalitarian approach and worked towards significant legislative reforms, including the Sarda Act (1929) against child marriage, the Hindu Women's Right to Property Act (1937), and later acts related to marriage, divorce, and dowry

Women’s organisations in pre-independence India played a key role in bringing together women from different regions and backgrounds. They created awareness, demanded legal reforms, and encouraged active participation in national movements. Their efforts laid the foundation for women's rights and representation in independent India.
