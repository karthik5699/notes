## Questions:

1. Discuss the main contributions of Gupta period and Chola period to Indian heritage and culture
2. How do you justify the view that the level of excellence of Gupta numismatic art is not at all noticeable in later times?

3. Numismatic Art
	- the Gupta coins are also pieces of art

	- were made from high-quality gold, silver, and copper, with a particular focus on purity and weight. This reflected the economic prosperity and stability of the Gupta Empire.
	- their coins frequently represented gods like Vishnu, Lakshmi, and Ganga, alongside rulers in divine or heroic poses. These depictions not only served as religious symbols but also emphasized the rulers’ divine authority
4. Science & Technology
	- the Gupta period is unparalleled for its achievements in mathematics & astronomy
	- zero '0' and the evolution of decimal system are credited to Gupta period. 
		- Brahmagupta, Aryabhatta, and Varahamihira were the earliest and foremost mathematicians and astronomers of the world.
	- Varahamihira wrote Brihat Samhita which deals with astronomy, astrology, botany, natural history, and physical geography. 
		- His famous work Panchasiddhantika summarised 5 astronomical schools
	- Brahmagupta is known for making important contributions to Geometry and hinting at the law of Gravitation
