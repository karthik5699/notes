![[Pasted image 20250729145616.png]]

- Introduction
	- It is formed from the Gondwana land breakup, thus making it a part of the oldest landmass and the most stable landmass of India.
	- The peninsular plateau includes the entire south India (Deccan Plateau and the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats), central India, Aravallis, Rajmahal hills, Meghalaya plateau and the Kutch-Kathiawar region (Gujarat)
- Features of the Peninsular Plateau
	- Roughly triangular in shape with its base coinciding with the southern edge of the great plain of North India. 
	- The average height of the plateau is 600-900 m above sea level
	- Most of the peninsular rivers flow west to east indicating it’s general slope
	- Narmada-Tapti are the exceptions which flow from east to west in a rift (rift is caused by divergent boundary
	- It is a highly stable block composed mostly of the Archaean gneisses and schists
- Minor Plateaus in the Peninsular Plateau
	- Marwar Plateau or Mewar Plateau
		- It is the plateau of eastern Rajasthan
		- It is made up of sandstone, shales and limestones of the Vindhayan period.
	- Central Highland
		- Also called the Madhya Bharat Pathar or Madhya Bharat Plateau.
		- Most of plateau comprises the basin of the Chambal river which flows in a rift valley.
		- To the north are the ravines or badlands of the Chambal river
	- Bundelkhand Upland
		- It is the old dissected (divided by a number of deep valleys) upland of the ‘Bundelkhand gneiss’ comprising of granite and gneiss.
		- Spreads over Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
		- The erosional work of the rivers flowing here have converted it into an undulating (wave like surface) area and rendered it <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">unfit for cultivation</mark>.
		- Streams like Betwa, Dhasan and Ken flow through the plateau
	- Malwa Plateau
		- The Malwa Plateau roughly forms a triangle based on the Vindhyan Hills, bounded by the Aravali Range in the west and Madhya Bharat Pathar to the north and Bundelkhand to the east
		- In the north it is drained by the Chambal and many of its right bank tributaries like the Kali, the Sindh and the Parbati. It also includes the upper courses of the Sindh, the Ken and the Betwa
		- It is composed of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">extensive lava flow and is covered with black soils.</mark>
		- In the north, the plateau is marked by the Chambal ravines

	- Baghelkhand
		- North of the Maikal Range is the Baghelkhand.
		- The central part of the plateau acts as a water divide between the Son drainage system in the north and the Mahanadi river system in the south.
	- Chhotanagpur Plateau
		- represents the north-eastern projection of the Indian Peninsula
		- Mostly in Jharkhand, northern part of Chhatisgarh and West Bengal
		- This plateau is composed mainly of Gondwana rocks
		- The plateau is drained by numerous rivers and streams in different directions and presents a radial drainage pattern.
		- Here are found the Gondwana coal fields which provide bulk of coal in India.
		- Rivers like the Damodar, the Subarnrekaha, the North Koel, the South Koel flow here
	- Meghalaya Plateau
		- The peninsular plateau extends further east beyond the Rajmahal hills to from Meghalaya or the Shillong plateau
		- The western, central and the eastern parts of the plateau are known as the Garo Hills (900 m), the Khasi-Jaintia Hills (1,500 m) and the Mikir Hills (700 m)
- Deccan Plateau
	- ![[Pasted image 20250729152517.png]]
	- It is triangular in shape and is bounded by the Satpura and the Vindhya in the north-west, the Mahadev and the Maikal in the north, the Western Ghats in the west and the Eastern Ghats in the east
	- Maharashtra Plateau
		- It forms the northern part of the Deccan Plateau
		- Much of the region is underlain by basaltic rocks of lava origin 
			- Most of the Deccan Traps lies in this region
			- ![[Pasted image 20250729152901.png]]
		- The entire area is covered by black cotton soil known as regur.
	- Karnataka Plateau
		- It is highly dissected by numerous rivers rising from the Western Ghats.
		- The general trend of the hills is either parallel to the Western Ghats or across it
		- The highest peak (1913 m) is at Mulangiri in Baba Budan Hills in Chikmagalur district
		- The plateau tapers between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats in the south and merges with the Nilgiri hills there
	- Telangana plateau
		- The Telangana plateau consists of Archaean gneisses
		- The region is drained by three river systems, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Penneru.
	- Chhattisgarh Plain
		- The Chhattisgarh plain is the only plain worth the name in the Peninsular plateau
		- It is a saucer shaped depression drained by the upper Mahanadi.
		- The region was once ruled by Haithaivanshi Rajputs from whose thirty six forts (Chhattisgarh) it derives its name.
