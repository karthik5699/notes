# Quantum Communication

- What was done:
	- Scientists from **IIT-Delhi and DRDO** successfully sent secret messages using **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** over **1 km of open air**, which makes computational attacks impossible without being noticed.
- Why it's special:
	- Unlike normal encryption, quantum encryption can **detect any eavesdropper instantly**. This makes it extremely secure—even against future **quantum computers**.
- National relevance:
	- This success supports **India’s National Quantum Mission (2023)**, which has ₹6,000 crore funding till 2031, and aims to make India a leader in quantum tech.
- Scaling potential:
	- If this tech is extended to **satellites**, it could allow **secure communication across India**—helpful for defence, diplomacy, and digital security
