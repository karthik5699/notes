# Tropical Cyclones

![[Pasted image 20250710172536.png]]

- Introduction
	- Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and move over to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction due to violent winds (squalls), very heavy rainfall (torrential rainfall) and storm surge.
	- They are irregular wind movements involving closed circulation of air around a low pressure center. 
	- This closed air circulation (whirling motion) is a result of rapid upward movement of hot air which is subjected to Coriolis force. 
	- The low pressure at the center is responsible for the wind speeds
	- The cyclonic wind movements are anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere (due to Coriolis force).
	- The cyclones are often characterized by existence of an anticyclone between two cyclones
- ### Conditions Favourable for Tropical Cyclone Formation
	- Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27° C
	- Presence of the Coriolis force enough to create a cyclonic vortex
	- Small variations in the vertical wind speed
	- A pre-existing weak low-pressure area 
- Good Source of Latent Heat
	- Ocean waters having temperatures of 27° C or more is the source of moisture which feeds the storm. 
	- The condensation of moisture releases enough latent heat of condensation to drive the storm.
- Why tropical cyclones form mostly on the western margins of the oceans?
	- The depth of warm water (26-27°C) should extend only for 60-70m from surface of the ocean/sea, so that deep convection currents within the water do not churn and mix the cooler water below with the warmer water near the surface.
	- The above condition occurs only in western tropical oceans because of warm ocean currents (easterly trade winds pushes ocean waters towards west) that flow from east towards west with temperatures greater than 27°C. 
	- The cold currents lower the surface temperatures of the eastern parts of the tropical oceans making them unfit for the breeding of cyclonic storms.
	- (One Exception: During strong El Nino years, strong hurricanes occur in the eastern Pacific. This is due to the accumulation of warm waters in the eastern Pacific due to weak Walker Cell)
- Coriolis Force (f)
	- The Coriolis force is zero at the equator (no cyclones at equator because of zero Coriolis Force) but it increases with latitude. Coriolis force at 5° latitude is significant enough to create a storm (cyclonic vortex).
	- About 65 per cent of cyclonic activity occurs between 10° and 20° latitude.
- Low-level Disturbances
	- ![[Pasted image 20250710174427.png]]
	- Low-level disturbance (thunderstorms – they are the seeds of cyclones) in the form of easterly wave disturbances in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) should pre-­exist
	- Small local differences in the temperature of water and of air produce various low pressure centers of small size. A weak cyclonic circulation develops around these areas.
	- Then, because of the rising warm humid air, a true cyclonic vortex may develop very rapidly. However, only a few of these disturbances develop into cyclones.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">(rising of humid air =>  adiabatic lapse rate => fall in temperature of air => condensation of moisture in air => latent heat of condensation released => air gets more hot and lighter => air is further uplifted => more air comes in to fill the gap => new moisture available for condensation => latent heat of condensation and the cycle repeats)</mark>
- Temperature contrast between air masses
	- Trade winds from both the hemispheres meet along inter-tropical front. Temperature contrasts between these air masses must exist when the ITCZ is farthest, from the equator.
	- Thus, the convergence of these air masses of different temperatures and the resulting instability are the prerequisites for the origin and growth of violent tropical storms
- Wind Shear
	- Wind Shear == differences between wind speeds at different heights
	- Tropical cyclones develop when the wind is uniform
	- Because of weak vertical wind shear, cyclone formation processes are limited to latitude equator-ward of the subtropical jet stream
	- In the temperate regions, wind shear is high due to westerlies and this inhibits convective cyclone formation
- Humidity Factor
	- High humidity (around 50 to 60 per cent) is required in the mid-troposphere, since the presence of moist air leads to the formation of cumulonimbus cloud
	- Such conditions exist over the equatorial doldrums, especially in western margins of oceans (this is because of east to west movement of ocean currents), which have great moisture, carrying capacity because the trade winds continuously replace the saturated air.
- ### Origin and Development of Tropical Cyclones
	- The tropical cyclones have a thermal origin, and they develop over tropical seas during late summers
	- At these locations, the strong local convectional currents acquire a whirling motion because of the Coriolis force
	- After developing, these cyclones advance till they find a weak spot in the trade wind belt
	- Origin
		- Under favourable conditions, multiple thunderstorms originate over the oceans. These thunderstorms merge and create an intense low pressure system
	- Early stage
		- In the thunderstorm, air is uplifted as it is warm and light. At certain height, due to lapse rate and adiabatic lapse rate, the temperature of air falls and moisture in the air undergoes condensation
		- Condensation releases latent heat of condensation making the air more warmer. It becomes much lighter and is further uplifted.
		- The space is filled by fresh moisture laden air. Condensation occurs in this air and the cycle is repeated as long as the moisture is supplied.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711140305.png]]
		- Due to excess moisture over oceans, the thunderstorm intensifies and sucks in air at much faster rate. The air from surroundings rushes in and undergoes deflection due to Coriolis force creating a cyclonic vortex (spiralling air column. Similar to tornado).
		- Due to centripetal acceleration (centripetal force pulling towards the center is countered by an opposing force called centrifugal force), the air in the vortex is forced to form a region of calmness called an eye at the center of the cyclone. The inner surface of the vortex forms the eye wall, the most violent region of the cyclone.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711140719.png]]
		- All the wind that is carried upwards loses its moisture and becomes cold and dense. It descends to the surface through the cylindrical eye region and at the edges of the cyclone
		- Continuous supply of moisture from the sea is the major driving force behind every cyclone. On reaching the land the moisture supply is cut off and the storm dissipates
		- If ocean can supply more moisture, the storm will reach a mature stage
	- Mature stage
		- ![[Pasted image 20250711141008.png]]
		- At this stage, the spiralling winds create multiple convective cells with successive calm and violent regions
		- The regions with cumulonimbus cloud (rising limbs of convective cell) formation are called **rain bands** below which intense rainfall occurs
		- The ascending air will lose moisture at some point and descends (subsides) back to surface through the calm regions (descending limbs of convection cell – subsiding air) that exist between two rain bands
		- Cloud formation is dense at the center. The cloud size decreases from center to periphery
		- Rain bands are mostly made up of cumulonimbus clouds. The ones at the periphery are made up of nimbostratus and cumulus clouds
- Structure of a tropical cyclone

	- Eye
		- The “eye” is a roughly circular area of comparatively light winds and fair weather found at the center of a severe tropical cyclone
		- There is little or no precipitation and sometimes blue sky or stars can be seen
	- Eye wall
		- The eye is surrounded by the “eye wall”, the roughly circular ring of deep convection, which is the area of highest surface winds in the tropical cyclone. 
		- Eye Wall region also sees the maximum sustained winds i.e. fastest winds in a cyclone occur along the eye wall region
		- The eye is composed of air that is slowly sinking and the eye wall has a net upward flow as a result of many moderate – occasionally strong – updrafts and downdrafts
		- The eye’s warm temperatures are due to compressional warming (adiabatic) of the subsiding air
	- Spiral bands
		- Another feature of tropical cyclones that probably plays a role in **forming and maintaining the eye** is the eye wall convection
		- Convection in tropical cyclones is organized into long, narrow rain bands which are oriented in the same direction as the horizontal wind
		- Because these bands seem to spiral into the center of a tropical cyclone, they are called “spiral bands”.
		- A direct circulation develops in which warm, moist air converges at the surface, ascends through these bands, diverges aloft, and descends on both sides of the bands
		- Subsidence is distributed over a wide area on the outside of the rain band but is concentrated in the small inside area.
		- As the air subsides, adiabatic warming takes place, and the air dries.
		- Because subsidence is concentrated on the inside of the band, the adiabatic warming is stronger inward from the band causing a sharp contrast in pressure falls across the band since warm air is lighter than cold air.
		- Because of the pressure falls on the inside, the tangential winds around the tropical cyclone increase due to increased pressure gradient. Eventually, the band moves toward the center and encircles it and the eye and eye wall form
		- Thus, the cloud-free eye may be due to a combination of dynamically forced centrifuging of mass out of the eye into the eye wall and to a forced descent caused by the moist convection of the eye wall

- Vertical Structure of a Tropical Cyclone
	- There are three divisions in the vertical structure of tropical cyclones.
		- The lowest layer, extending up to 3 km and known as the inflow layer, is responsible for driving the storm
		- The middle layer, extending from 3 km to 7 km, is where the main cyclonic storm takes place
		- The outflow layer lies above 7 km. The maximum outflow is found at 12 km and above. The movement of air is anticyclonic in nature

## Personal Analysis:

When the sea surface temperature (SST) is above about **26.5°C**, water evaporates, rises, condenses into clouds, and releases **latent heat** (the hidden energy stored in water vapor). This heat powers the cyclones.
