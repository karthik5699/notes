# Fronts

Understanding Front Formation and Types of Fronts is important to understand the formation of Mid-latitude cyclones ([[Temperate Cyclones]] or extra-tropical cyclones)

- Introduction
	- Fronts are the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">typical features of midlatitudes weather</mark> (temperate region: 30° – 65° N and S). They are uncommon (unusual) in tropical and polar regions.
	- Front is a three dimensional boundary zone formed between two converging air masses with different physical properties 
	- The two air masses don’t merge readily
- Front Formation
	- The process of formation of a front is known as Frontogenesis (war between two air masses), and dissipation of a front is known as Frontolysis (one of the air masses win against the other).
	- In northern hemisphere Frontogenesis (convergence of air masses) happens in anti-clockwise direction and in southern hemisphere, clockwise direction. This is due to Coriolis effect.
	- Mid-latitude cyclones or temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones occur due to frontogenesis
- General Characteristics of Fronts
	- The temperature contrast influences the thickness of frontal zone in an inversely proportional manner, i.e., two air masses with higher temperature difference do not merge readily. So the front formed is less thick.
	- The frontal activity is invariably associated with cloudiness and precipitation because of ascent of warm air which cools down adiabatically, condenses and causes rainfall.
	- The intensity of precipitation depends on the slope of ascent and amount of water vapour present in ascending air.
- Classification of Fronts
	- Based on the mechanism of frontogenesis and the associated weather, the fronts can be studied under the following types.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250709141251.png]]
	- Stationary Front
		- When the surface position of a front does not change (when two air masses are unable to push against each other; a draw), a stationary front is formed.
		- ![[Pasted image 20250709141333.png]]
		- The wind motion on both sides of the front is parallel to the front.
		- Once this boundary resumes its forward motion, becomes a warm front or cold front.
		- Weather along a stationary front
			- Cumulonimbus clouds are formed. Overrunning of warm air along such a front causes frontal precipitation
			- Cyclones migrating along a stationary front can dump heavy amounts of precipitation, resulting in significant flooding along the front
	- Cold Front
		- Such a front is formed when a cold air mass replaces a warm air mass by advancing into it or that the warm air mass retreats and cold air mass advances (cold air mass is the clear winner).
		- ![[Pasted image 20250709141830.png]]
		- In such a situation, the transition zone between the two is a cold front
		- Cold front moves upto twice as quickly as warm fronts
		- Frontolysis begin when the warm air mass is completely uplifted by the cold air mass
		- Weather along a cold front
			- ![[Pasted image 20250709141953.png]]
			- Severe storms can occur. During the summer months thunderstorms are common in warm sector
			- In some regions like USA tornadoes occur in warm sector
			- Temperatures can drop more than 15 degrees within the first hour.
		- Cloud formation along a cold front
			- The approach of a cold front is marked by increased wind activity in warm sector and the appearance of cirrus clouds, followed by lower, denser alto-cumulous
			- ![[Pasted image 20250709142154.png]]
			- At actual front, dark nimbus and cumulonimbus clouds cause heavy showers. A cold front passes off rapidly, but the weather along it is violent
	- Warm Front
		- It is a sloping frontal surface along which active movement of warm air over cold air takes place (warm air mass is too weak to beat the cold air mass).
		- ![[Pasted image 20250709142758.png]]
		- Weather along a warm front
			- As the warm air moves up the slope, it condenses and causes precipitation but, unlike a cold front, the temperature and wind direction changes are gradual
			- Such fronts cause moderate to gentle precipitation over a large area, over several hours
			- The passage of warm front is marked by rise in temperature
		- Clouds along a warm front
			- ![[Pasted image 20250709143007.png]]
			- With the approach, the hierarchy of clouds is—-cirrus, stratus and nimbus. (No cumulonimbus clouds as the gradient is gentle)
	- Occluded Front
		- ![[Pasted image 20250709143921.png]]
		- Occlusion: Process by which the cold front of a rotating low-pressure system catches up the warm front, so that the warm air between them is forced upwards
		- Such a front is formed when a cold air mass overtakes a warm air mass and goes underneath it.
		- Frontolysis begin when warm sector diminishes and the cold air mass completely undertakes the warm sector on ground
		- Weather along an occluded front
			- Weather along an occluded front is complex—a mixture of cold front type and warm front type weather. Such fronts are common in west Europe
			- The formation Mid-latitude cyclones (temperate cyclones or extra-tropical cyclones) involve the formation of occluded front
		- Clouds along an occluded front
			- A combination of clouds formed at cold front and warm front.
			- ![[Pasted image 20250709144414.png]]
			- Warm front clouds and cold front clouds are on opposite side of the occlusion
- Cold Front, Warm Front and Occluded front are examples of Temperature Inversion
