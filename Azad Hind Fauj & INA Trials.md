## Questions:

1. Highlight the differences in the approach of Subhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for freedom.

# Azad Hind Fauj & INA Trials

The Indian National Army (INA), led by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, represents a militant phase of India’s freedom struggle during World War II. Unlike the Gandhian approach of non-violence, Bose believed that armed resistance was necessary to oust British imperialism.

Genesis and Evolution of INA:
- Originally founded by Mohan Singh in 1942 with Japanese support in Southeast Asia
- The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war to Mohan Singh who tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army
- The INA got a boost with the outbreak of the Quit India Movement in India
- However, serious differences emerged between the Indian officers like Mohan Singh and the Japanese over the role of the INA
	- the Japanese desired only a token force (2,000 men), while Mohan Singh wanted a much larger army, leading to his arrest by the Japanese

Subhash Chandra Bose's Leadership:
- The second phase of the INA began with the arrival of Subhas Bose in Singapore
- Rashbehari Bose, who had organized the Indian Independence League, placed the INA under this league and happily transferred control and leadership to Subhas in July 1943
- Subhas Bose formed the Provisional Government of Azad Hind as head of state, the prime minister and the minister for war and foreign affairs. 
- The famous slogan--"<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Give me blood, I will give you freedom</mark>" was given in Malaya
- This government declared war on Britain and the United States, and was recognized by the Axis powers
- The INA headquarters was shifted to Rangoon in January 1944, with the war cry "Chalo Delhi!
- Subhas Bose addressed Mahatma Gandhi as 'Father of Nation' from the Azad Hind Radio (the 1st person to call Gandhi, 'Father of Nation') and sought blessings for "India's last war of independence"
- the steady Japanese retreat thereafter quashed hopes of liberating India
- The INA surrendered with Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945

##### Post-War Impact - The INA Trials (1945-46)
- When the INA POWs were brought back to India to be court-martialled, a powerful movement emerged in their defence
- The INA trials (Red Fort Trials) evoked mass nationalist support, including from within the British Indian Army
- The Congress strongly supported the INA prisoners, organizing the defence through prominent leaders like Bhulabhai Desai, Tej Bahadur Sapru, K.N. Katju, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Asaf Ali
- Historians like R.C. Majumdar and Sumit Sarkar note INA’s psychological impact on both colonial authorities and Indian masses
- Instrumental in triggering [[RIN Mutiny 1946]]

While INA did not achieve direct military victory, it catalysed a nationalist upsurge and exposed the vulnerability of British rule in India. _Subhash Chandra Bose’s vision of a free and assertive India_ continues to inspire patriotism and assertive diplomacy even today. As Nehru noted, _Bose’s contribution was no less than Gandhi’s in arousing national pride._
