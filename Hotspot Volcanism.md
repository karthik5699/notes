## Questions:

1. Define mantle plume and explain its role in plate tectonics.

# Hotspot Volcanism

A type of volcanism that typically occurs at the **interior parts of the lithospheric plates** rather than at the zones of convergence and divergence (plate margins).

Hotspot volcanism explains the so-called anomalous volcanism â€” the type that occurs far from plate boundaries, like in Hawaii and Yellowstone.

Hotspot volcanism occurs due to abnormally hot centres in the mantle known as mantle plumes.

#### Mantle Plumes
- The convection of abnormally hot rock (magma) within the Earthâ€™s mantle
- Mantle plumes are theorised to form at the core-mantle boundary where an abnormally hot plume of rock accumulates

- The mantle plume is shaped like a mushroom with a long conduit (tail) connecting the bulbous head to its base. The head expands in size as the plume rises.
- ##### Mantle plumes and flood basalt volcanism (large igneous provinces)
	- On the continents, mantle plumes have been responsible for extensive accumulations of flood basalts.
	- Mantle plumes and rise slowly towards the upper mantle
	- When a plume head encounters the base of the lithosphere, it flattens out and forms **large volumes of basalt magma**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250630161033.png]]
	- The basaltic magma may then erupt onto the surface through a series of fissures giving rise to large igneous provinces
	- Examples of Large igneous provinces are Iceland, Siberian Traps, Deccan Traps, and Ontong Java Plateau
- Hotspot volcano chain
	- A volcano above a hotspot does not erupt forever. Attached to the tectonic plate below, the volcano moves and is eventually cut off from the hotspot (plate moves overhead relative to the fixed plume source).
	- ![[Pasted image 20250630161522.png]]
	- A new and active volcano develops over the hotspot creating a continuous cycle of volcanism, forming a volcanic arc that parallels plate motion
- Role in Plate Tectonics
	- Initiation of Rifting
		- When a mantle plume head ascends and impinges on the base of the lithosphere, it delivers a large heat flux to the overlying plate. This creates several effects:
			- **Thermal doming**: The lithosphere swells upwards due to thermal expansion
			- **Extensional stresses**: The uplift causes radial stretching and thinning of the crust, making it mechanically weak
			- **Partial melting**: Decompression melting in the asthenosphere produces magma, which further weakens and intrudes the crust
		- This combination of uplift + thermal weakening + magma injection makes the region more susceptible to rifting
		- Eg: East African Rift
