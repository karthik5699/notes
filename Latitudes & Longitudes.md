## Questions:



# Latitudes & Longitudes

- Latitudes and Longitudes are imaginary lines used to determine the location of a place on earth
- The shape of the earth is ‘Geoid’. And the location of a place on the earth can be mentioned in terms of latitudes and longitudes

- Latitude
	- Latitude is the angular distance of a point on the earth’s surface, measured in degrees from the center of the earth
	- *<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">As the earth is slightly flattened at the poles, the linear distance of a degree of latitude at the pole is a little longer than that at the equator.</mark>*
	- Important parallels of latitudes
		- Tropic of Cancer (23½° N) in the northern hemisphere
		- Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S) in the southern hemisphere
		- Arctic circle at 66½° north of the equator
		- Antarctic circle at 66½° south of the equator
	- Latitudinal Heat zones of the earth

		- The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least once a year on all latitudes in between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. 
			- This area, therefore, receives the maximum heat and is called the **torrid zone.**
		- The areas bounded by the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic circle in the northern hemisphere, and the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic circle in the southern hemisphere, have moderate temperatures. 
			- These are, therefore, called **temperate zones**
		- Areas lying between the Arctic circle and the north pole in the northern hemisphere and the Antarctic circle and the south pole in the southern hemisphere, are very cold
			- These are, therefore, called **frigid zones**
- Longitude
	- Longitude is an angular distance, measured in degrees along the equator east or west of the Prime (or First) Meridian
	- Prime Meridian passes through the **Royal Astronomical Observatory at Greenwich, near London**.
	- They determine local time in relation to G.M.T. or Greenwich Mean Time, which is sometimes referred to as World Time
	- Since the earth makes one complete revolution of 360° in one day or 24 hours, it passes through 15° in one hour
	- The earth rotates from west to east, so every 15° we go eastwards, local time is advanced by 1 hour. Con­versely, if we go westwards, local time is retarded by 1 hour.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250702164726.png]]
	- We may thus conclude that places east of Greenwich see the sun earlier and gain time, whereas places west of Greenwich see the sun later and lose time.
- Standard Time and Time Zones
	- Most countries adopt their standard time from the central meridian of their countries
	- In larger countries such as **Canada, U.S.A., China, and U.S.S.R**, it would be inconvenient to have single time zone. So these countries have multiple time zones
	- Both Canada and U.S.A. have five time zones
- The International Date Line
	- A traveler going eastwards gains time from Green­wich until he reaches the meridian 180°E, when he will be 12 hours ahead of G.M.T.
	- Similarly in going westwards, he loses 12 hours when he reaches 180°W. 
	- There is thus a total difference of 24 hours or a whole day between the two sides of the 180° meridian.
	- This is the International Date Line where the date changes by exactly one day when it is crossed.
	- 🌏 **Example:**
		- Let’s say it’s Monday, 10 AM just west of the IDL (e.g., in Fiji).
		- If you fly east across the IDL to Hawaii, it becomes Sunday, 10 AM — you gain a day.
		- If you fly west from Hawaii back to Fiji, it becomes Monday again — you lose a day.

	- Some groups of Islands fall on either of the dateline. So if the dateline was straight, then two regions of the same Island Country or Island group would fall under different date zones. Thus to avoid any confusion of date, this line is drawn through where the sea lies and not land.
- Indian Standard Time
	- The Indian Government has accep­ted the meridian of 82.5° east for the standard time which is 5 hours 30 mins, ahead of Greenwich Mean Time
