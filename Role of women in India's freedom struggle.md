# Role of women in India's freedom struggle

![[Pasted image 20250722181009.png]]

Indian women played a significant and increasingly active role in the struggle for freedom, defying traditional barriers of age, gender, and religion and becoming important participants in various movements.

##### Defying Gender Barriers
- Traditionally, women were often confined to the home, suppressed by practices like purdah, early marriage, and restrictions on movement and education
- Early Female Resistance
	- Women like Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, Rani Chennamma of Kittur, and Begum Hazrat Mahal led armed rebellions against the British during the early years of resistance, showcasing immense courage and leadership skills
		- General Hugh Rose, who defeated Rani Lakshmi Bai, paid tribute, calling her <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"the only man among the rebels"</mark>
- Swadeshi Movement (1905-08)
	- Women from diverse backgrounds participated in the Swadeshi Movement
	- they actively engaged in picketing and the burning of foreign goods to protest British policies.
- Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22)
	- Gandhiji played a crucial role in encouraging women to come out of their homes
	- Women gave up purdah and offered their ornaments for the Tilak Fund. They joined the movement in large numbers and took active part in picketing before the shops selling foreign cloth and liquor.
	- Basanti Debi, wife of C.R. Das, was one of the first women volunteers to court arrest in 1921
- The Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-34)
	- further cemented their public role
	- Gandhi specifically asked women to take a leading part, and they became a familiar sight picketing shops
	- Sarojini Naidu, a significant leader, had to persuade Gandhiji to allow women's participation in the Salt Satyagraha, demonstrating their resolve to be involved
- Quit India Movement (1942)
	- women like <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Aruna Asaf Ali, Usha Mehta, and Sucheta Kriplani</mark> played critical roles in organizing mass protests, operating clandestine radio stations, and leading local resistance groups
- Later in 1943
	- Subhash Chandra Bose formed a women’s regiment in the INA in 1943, named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, which was led by Captain Laxmi Sehgal

##### Defying Age Barriers
- While many participants were young, the movement saw participation across age groups. Rani Gaidinliu began her revolt against foreign rule at the young age of 13. 
- On the other end of the spectrum, Matangini Hazra, a 73-year-old peasant widow, was killed while keeping the national flag aloft during the Quit India Movement in 1942

##### Defying Religious/Caste Barriers
- In the Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements, Hindu and Muslim women participated together, with large numbers of Muslim women joining and contributing to the movement's mass character in some areas
	- The fraternization that was witnessed between Hindus and Muslims, with Gandhiji and other Congress leaders speaking from mosques, Gandhiji being allowed to address meetings of Muslim women in which he was the only male who was not blind-folded, all these would begin to look like romantic dreams in later years


In essence, Indian women, motivated by a growing nationalist consciousness and a desire for social change, actively challenged and overcame deeply ingrained societal restrictions related to their age, prescribed gender roles, and sometimes religious or caste divisions, to participate in and contribute significantly to the various phases of the Indian freedom struggle, becoming key figures and inspirations within the movement.

## Personal Analysis:

After India achieved independence in 1947, Lakshmi Bai’s legacy continued to flourish. Indian poet Subhadra Kumari Chauhan penned “Jhansi Ki Rani,” a poem in Lakshmi Bai’s honor, which is taught to schoolchildren all over India to this day.

खूब लड़ी मर्दानी वह तो झाँसी वाली रानी थी।।</mark>

“This story we heard from the mouths of Bundel bards / Like a man she fought, she was the Queen of Jhansi"
